# Hot Ticket: Puscifer @ Lisner Auditorium, 11/26/11

Puscifer never would’ve been on my radar if it weren’t for Maynard James Keenan, the mysterious frontman of Tool and A Perfect Circle. Like all Tool fans, I’ve learned to expect long waits between albums (it’s been 5 1/2 years since the last one, by the way). I imagine Maynard has an infinite supply of creative energy, as he’s always working on something – he just keeps focusing it on the wrong things, like his vineyard in Arizona. Or Puscifer’s 2007 album, “V is for Vagina”, which struck me as a collection of half-baked songs serving up unfunny innuendo.

Can we just ignore that one? Puscifer’s latest album “Conditions of My Parole” shows that they can actually write songs. The tracks sound more like an alt-country version of Maynard’s other bands – the same ominous tone, with the intenity turned down. But the live show is what makes the band. Puscifer shows are part comedy, part cabaret, and unlike anything else out there. Check them out on Saturday to get a taste of the ideas Maynard can’t quite fit into his usual projects.
