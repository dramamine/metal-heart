# Hot Ticket: Das Racist @ Rock & Roll Hotel, 1/14/11
Have you been around the internet lately? There’s a duo of self-proclaimed “internet thugs” that found a new formula for success. Apparently, you can rhyme about G-chat, Youtube, and Macbooks, and end up selling out the Rock & Roll Hotel on Friday night.

When I first listened to Das Racist my first thought was, “these are the whitest rappers I’ve ever heard!”. Oh, wait, I was totally wrong (they almost discuss identity politics here). These guys met at Wesleyan and I would call there music “college rap” – intelligent verses with an off-the-cuff, stream-of-consciousness style. You can read some of their most creative lines here. I resisted listening to them for a long time having written them off as a novelty after their hit song “Combination Pizza Hut & Taco Bell”. But since then they’ve gotten serious; releasing two excellent mixtapes last year (available for free!) that had a huge list of guest stars, including Jay-Z and Diplo.

DC locals Ardamus and the Metaphysical and Houston’s Fat Tony are setting up the night to be a non-stop party. If you don’t have tickets to the show, you can still attend the dance party upstairs (no cover charge) running until 2:30am.

    I like how you guys point out to cool shows that you think are coming and all, but why point to a sold out show?
