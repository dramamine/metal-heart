# Hot Ticket: Mogwai @ 9:30 Club, 4/19/11
UPDATE: According to their official website, Mogwai are postponing this date until October due to issues with their visa. All tickets for this show will be honored.

Mogwai. How do I even begin recommending that you check out my favorite band of all time? I’d rather you not even come, in case you don’t understand what they’re about. In fact, I’d prefer that we keep the crowd really small – like, just me and the band members, please.

I know, it ain’t gonna happen. This Tuesday, Mogwai are sure to pack the 9:30 Club again. Mogwai are legends of the post-rock scene, who “invented,” or at least popularized, the genre along with bands like Explosions in the Sky and Godspeed You Black Emperor. They earned the motto “loudest band in the world” from their devastating live shows. And yeah, it’s going be loud – the last few times I’ve seen them, they’ve hit notes that I could feel rattling my bones.

The typical Mogwai song has a melancholy air to it, building up slowly to a burst of energy and noise and bliss. Mogwai have distilled this formula to perfection; while I prefer the older albums, each new album they release have a couple of songs designed to show their strength live. I’m looking forward to checking out Rano Pano and San Pedro from their February release, Hardcore Will Never Die, But You Will. Any fan of loud music or instrumental rock needs to check out this band right now. Anyone looking for an intense concert experience should be there on Tuesday.
