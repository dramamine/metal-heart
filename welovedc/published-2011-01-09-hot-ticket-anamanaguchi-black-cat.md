# Hot Ticket: Anamanaguchi @ Black Cat 1/9/11

Anamanaguchi are returning to the Black Cat Backstage this Sunday with their signature brand of punk/power-pop.  Oh, and they’re bringing their hacked Nintendo.

Anamanaguchi are quickly becoming one of the most infamous “chiptunes” bands around.  In the past year, they’ve composed the soundtracks to video games including Scott Pilgrim vs The World: The Game, and are slated to appear in the next version of Rock Band.  They also grabbed minor media attention for holding a vigil in support of Four Loko in NYC last November.

When I imagine a chiptunes concert, I usually think of scrawny high-schoolers bent over their Gameboys, with pixelated graphics running on a projecter.  However, Anamanaguchi bring a ton of energy to their live show; the drums are front-and-center, and the Nintendo blends with the guitar lines, rather than sticking out as a gimmick.  These guys have a ton of positive energy; it’s like a re-imagined Weezer.  You’ll leave with a smile on your face.
