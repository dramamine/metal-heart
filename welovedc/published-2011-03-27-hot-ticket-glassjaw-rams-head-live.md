# Hot Ticket: Glassjaw @ Ram’s Head Live, 3/27/11
Glassjaw. Have you heard of this band? If so, you probably haven’t thought much about them in the last eight years, which is how long I’ve been waiting for them to release new material since their album Worship and Tribute. Their singer Daryl Palumbo has been off playing with various side projects, such as electro-pop group Head Automatica and, um, disco revival group Men Women & Children. Glassjaw never really disbanded, though. Because of various legal issues with various record labels, all I’ve heard over the years are a couple live recordings of the new songs they’ve written.

Until now. Touring in support of their new Coloring Book EP, their first studio recordings since 2003, the closest Glassjaw is coming to DC is their show at Ram’s Head Live in Baltimore this Sunday. Of course I’ll be there –they’re one of my favorite post-hardcore bands. I always felt like these guys were supposed to join bands like Deftones in bringing heavy, catchy music to the masses. If you could hear anything heavier than Nickelback on the radio these days, maybe you’d hear amazing new tracks like this. Or maybe you’d already know that Daryl is one of the most dynamic, passionate, reckless frontmen out there. Instead, you’re lucky I’m here to tell you not to miss out on this show.
