# Hot Ticket: Darkest Hour @ 9:30 Club, 2/25/11
Darkest Hour should be familiar to anyone following the hardcore scene in DC. Having played as a band for 15 years now, these guys have perfected their blend of metalcore, combining hardcore singing and screaming with fiery death metal riffs. To celebrate the release of their new album, The Human Romance, they put together a huge metal tour that’s kicking off at the 9:30 Club this Friday.

The show is part of the 3rd annual Atticus Metal tour, featuring a slew of metalcore bands from around the country – The Human Abstract and As Blood Runs Black from LA, and Born of Osiris from Chicago. These are some of the top bands in the metalcore scene these days, if that’s your sort of thing. And you know what? It’s my sort of thing, because I love huge riffs. I love headbanging. Sometimes I have to headbang next to a bunch of Myspace kids, but I can deal. Of these, I’m most excited for The Human Abstract, the most metal, least ‘scene’ of these bands – their sound borrows from progressive metal groups like Opeth or Between the Buried and Me.

Friday night will really be all about Darkest Hour, though. The local kids go CRAZY for this band! If you like moshing, hardcore dancing, or just headbanging in the back, I’ll see you there.
