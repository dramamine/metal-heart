# Hot Ticket: Pinback @ Black Cat, 5/1/11
This Sunday night, indie rockers Pinback return to the Black Cat to deliver a set of positive, upbeat guitar grooves.

Pinback’s front man Rob Crow has been all over the map musically, playing in groups as diverse as math rockers Three Mile Pilot, Chino Moreno’s spacey electro project Team Sleep, and sludge metal outfit Goblin Cock. He’s one of those guys that’s bursting at the seams with songwriting skills, like he can’t help but write catchy tunes in any style with any musical partners.

It’s been four years since we’ve heard any new Pinback material since their breakthrough “Autumn of the Seraphs”, but with Record Store Day two weeks ago, fans were treated to an EP with two new Pinback songs. I’m curious to see what the show will be like this time – how much new/unreleased material will they play? Will they try playing stripped-down versions of their songs, like last summer when they performed as just a two-piece? Let’s find out.
