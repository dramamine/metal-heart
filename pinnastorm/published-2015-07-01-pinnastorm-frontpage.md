Pinnastorm was a fun blog that my friend Amanda Mattos ran from 2010-2011. She had it all - culture posts, musician interviews, show previews and song reviews. I forget how this came together exactly, but I was probably running my mouth about [mylifeismetal](/tag/mylifeismetal/) or something at a partly. When Pinnastorm was coming together, she approached me and asked for content, whatever I wanted to write really. I said, hellz yeah!

Pinnastorm was a fun creative outlet for me. I had a couple stupid/genius ideas for posts and got to run wild with them. These are still some of my favorite things I've written! I cite [A Hipster Reviews, What Was The Hipster?](a-hipster-reviews-what-was-the-hipster/) all the time to shut down any and all idiotic conversations about hipsterdom. [MP3s or the Misery](which-came-first-the-mp3s-or-the-misery/) was a fun way to write some silly emo shit in completely fictional context. The [Digital Drugs](digital-drugs-a-trip-report/) was a ridiculous exercise in listening-to-stupid-shit. This also led to my most popular post on Soundcloud - I uploaded a $100 i-Dose (I think it was "Gate of Hades"), which was up for about 4 years before it got copyright-claimed.

The blog is gone and the domain replaced by a mommy blog. Sigh!
