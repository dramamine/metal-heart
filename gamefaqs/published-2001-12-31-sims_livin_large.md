What is Livin' Large?
*********************
Livin' Large is an expansion pack for The Sims, a very successful game from
Maxis.  It adds many new elements to the original game, including 125 new
items, five new jobs, new skins, etc.  It is a wise investment for anybody who
enjoyed the original and wants to extend its life a bit more.

*******************
What is this guide?
*******************
This guide explains the new elements of the game in extreme detail.  However,
I won't go into depth about the strategies you should use with these items.
You can figure that out yourself...but I'll tell you all the facts you need to
know about the items to make wise choices.  I found just about everything in
this guide completely by myself, so I'm sure I've missed quite a few things.  
Please email me if you have anything to add to this guide after checking the
Contact Info at the bottom of this guide.

***********************************
Can I use this guide on my website?
***********************************
It depends.  Here's how it is:

YOU MUST E-MAIL ME(slodeth@iname.com) AND ASK FOR PERMISSION!

You may not make any changes to it.  You can ask, but the answer will be "no"
 in almost every case.

You cannot make it seem like you wrote the guide yourself IN ANY WAY.  It must
 be clear that it is my original work.

You may not re-write it yourself in your own style.  It's called plagiarism.
 Even if you change every word, plagiarism is the theft of IDEAS.

If I grant you permission by E-mail, you should give me an E-mail address which
 I can inform you about updates to the guide.

If I grant you permission by E-mail, you should give me a hyperlink to the web
 site on which you post the guide.

**********************
Can I send you E-mail?
**********************
Yes, but PLEASE read the Contact Info section at the bottom of the guide!

Comparison Chart
****************
Here's a quick comparison with the old jobs...these statistics are for the
tenth(highest) level of each career track, ranked by descending pay per hour:

CareerTrack       | Hours | Pay | Stats | Friends | Pay Per Hour
Entertainment     |   5   |1400 |  30   |  14     | 280
Musician          |   5   |1400 |  37   |  15     | 280
Science           |   4   |1000 |  35   |  10     | 250
Athletic          |   6   |1300 |  28   |  13     | 217
Business          |   6   |1200 |  27   |  14     | 200
Journalist        |   6   |1200 |  31   |  14     | 200
Paranormal        |   6   |1200 |  32   |  17     | 200
Crime             |   6   |1100 |  32   |  12     | 183
Hacker            |   9   |1550 |  35   |   8     | 172
Extreme           |   6   | 925 |  39   |  11     | 154
Slacker           |   4   | 600 |  24   |  15     | 150
Politics          |   6   | 750 |  26   |  17     | 125
Medicine          |   7   | 850 |  32   |  11     | 121
Law Enforcement   |   6   | 700 |  33   |  12     | 117
Military          |   6   | 650 |  37   |   8     | 108

So...how do you choose a career now?  Well...the truth is, you can succeed with
absolutely any job.  The path of the least resistance is still the 
Entertainment field.  It gives you the most money for the least work.  However,
you should pick a job which fits your playing style.  Don't like making friends
and the upkeep of the relationships?  Pick a job with a low Friend requirement,
like Science or Hacker.  Have full stats already?  Keep enough friends and you
can have any job you want, or switch jobs whenever you want and receive money
from bonuses.  Don't mind working long hours?  Hacker is for you.  Don't have
time to build stats?  Go with Slacker, it's just right for you.


---------
NEW ITEMS
---------
The back of the box boasts 125 NEW ITEMS!  Most of these are just more of the
same, but several add quite a bit of depth to the game.  I'll leave the
decorative items and such out of this guide, and instead concentrate on the
items that change the game...

***********
NEW SEATING
***********

Antique Four-Poster Bed-----------$3650, Comfort 10, Energy 9, Room 4
Nothing special about it, but it replaces the Modern Mission Bed as the best
bed in terms of stats.

The Vibromatic Heart Bed----------$4500, Comfort 10, Energy 8, Group Activity
Your Sims now have the option to Play in Bed...send one Sim to turn the bed to
Vibrate.  While that Sim lays in the bed, send a loved one to Play in Bed.
They play their games...the Fun and Social level increases.  One unfortunate
side effect of this activity is a baby...you've been warned.

**************
NEW DECORATIVE
**************

"Tragic Clown" Painting-----------$45, Room 2
I know the painting is new, but I don't know about this...if your Sims are sad,
and you have this painting, a Tragic Clown will come from a hole in the ground
to visit your house.  He coughs and sniffles all over the house.  If you try
to do anything with him besides insult him, it will only frustrate you and make
you both sadder.  When you insult him, you feel better.  How tragic!

* UPDATE * You can download Clown Catchers at the website(www.thesims.com) to
spare yourself the trouble of putting up with this guy.  If you didn't buy the
game, you can't download it...too bad!  Go buy it.


Suit of Armor---------------------$15000, Room 10
Now tied for the most expensive item in the game.  It often goes up in value,
so feel free to invest in a few of them.

***************
NEW ELECTRONICS
***************

Introducing Servo-----------------$15000
Also tied for the most expensive item in the game.  This robot walks around the
house cleaning, repairing, and gardening so you don't have to!  Turn it on and
it will walk around until there's nothing left to do.  You can also tell it to
Serve a meal, but the meals aren't very filling.  Don't waste your money on
this unless you have way too much money or very messy people.

**************
NEW APPLIANCES
**************

Olde Thyme Restored Oven----------$1600, Hunger 9
This replaces the gas range as the best oven.

Olde Thyme Victual Preservatorium-$2750, Hunger 9
This replaces the Freeze Secret as the best refrigerator.  Great name, too!

*****************
NEW MISCELLANEOUS
*****************

Little Voodoo Dolly---------------$65, Fun 1, adults only
Lets you torture another member of the family.  What fun!

Sky Scorcher Fireworks Kit--------$90, Fun 2
Light a rocket, but watch out!  It lands with a small explosion.  Great for
people who like to kill their own Sims...just light a few inside your house.
For everyone else, keep it outside and away from the house.

Antique Lamp----------------------$375, Room 2
You can View this lamp like a piece of artwork, but you can also Clean it once
a day.  A genie will pop out when you Clean it, giving you a choice between
two elements.  Then, the genie will randomly choose a positive or negative
outcome.  Here's what can happen...

  Choice  |       Positive Outcome          |          Negative Outcome
===============================================================================
Money     | pot of gold                     | three overdue bills
Love      | somebody falls in love with you | sombebody hates you

Work      | three skill points              | every skill loses a point
Leisure   | pinball machine                 | something catches on fire

Fire      | everybody feels better          | something catches on fire
Water     | fountain                        | flood

Earth     | all plants are beautified       | all plants die/new dead plants 
Air       | pink flamingoes                 | roaches

Friends   | new friend                      | friend likes you less
Family    | family member likes you more    | family crisis!


Beejaphone Guitar-----------------$580, Fun 2, +Creativity, Group Activity
My personal favorite new item.  Adds to Creativity, but with a new twist: Sims
can watch you as you practice.  If you aren't very good, they'll exert their
disapproval and like you less.  If you're better, they'll cheer you on and like
you more.  Heavy Clown forever!

KraftKing Woodworking Table-------$720, +Mechanical, adults only
This adds to Mechanical skills.  Unlike reading a book, this creates garden
gnomes which you can sell or put on your lawn.

Madame Blahbatfry Crystal Ball----$760, adults only
This object will give you a random riddle.  Do as it says, and you may be
rewarded.  You can increase personality points or lose the ones you have.

The "Concoctanation Station"------$980, +Logic, adults only
This will improve your Logic by making potions.  Drinking these potions will
have different effects on you...

Also, be careful with this one.  If you use it too much, the cops will come
and fine you $500, since the kids at school can smell the fumes all the way
from school.

"Freaking Frankenstein! [Name] has been turned into a monster!"
The Sim turns into a monster, running around the house and breaking all sorts
of things.  It turns back in a few hours, but you'll need a repairman for quite
awhile to fix the damage.
(light purple)

"Yuck!  Whatever that was, it made you feel terrible!"
All of the Sims' Needs go down completely, except Room.
(light green)

"That tasted great!  You feel totally refreshed!"
The Sims' Needs are raised.  Three(random) needs are filled to the max.  Good
substitute for sleep!
(light blue)

"Somebody has fallen in love with [Name]!"
The best potion, another Sim instantly falls in love with you, greeting you
with a passionate kiss.
(red)

"It's a parthenogenesis party! [Name] has created an evil clone!"
Yeah, you accidentally clone yourself.  The twin isn't really evil at all.
It mostly just walks around to talk with people.
(light green)

"Holy reverse proportionality!  Your personality has been permanently 
reversed!"
All your personality bars are reversed.  Because of this, you might want to try
making a Sim or two with no points in the beginning, then give them a potion
and turn them into the perfect Sim!
(yellow)

I think there are eight potions in all, but I've only found these six after
DAYS of experimenting.  I hear one of them makes you invisible.



Horrorwitz "Star-Track" Outdoor Telescope-$2100, +Logic, Fun 4
Another way to increase Logic.  Be careful, though...if you use it too much
(two or three points without taking a break at least), you'll be abducted by
aliens!  A blue sphere picks you up and you disappear for a few hours.  Some
of your family will think about you and weep by the telescope.  When you
return, you'll think about aliens for awhile.

Liebefunkenmann Piano---------$5399, Fun 4, Room 6, +Creativity, Group Activity
Works just like the electric guitar, but it's bigger, nicer, and more fun,
according to the game...but everyone knows the guitar is just as fun.

*****************
WHAT ELSE IS NEW?
*****************
-Roaches.  Yes, roaches.  Keep your house clean, or you'll have a problem.  You
 can Spray them(they die quickly), Stomp on them(automatic), or let them run
 around your house.  NOTE: If you have trouble Spraying them, walk over near
 them FIRST, then Spray them.  When they move around, your Spray order gets
 cancelled, so you need to be near them before you try to Spray.
-When somebody dies, you can Plead with the Grim Reaper.  He will either spare
 the Sim, turn the Sim into a Zombie, or let the Sim die.
-More neighborhoods.  Five neighborhoods means you can have a total of fifty
 houses.  This is great when your household has more than one person who wants
 to play the game, so you can keep your Sims separated.
