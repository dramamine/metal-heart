What is Bill and Ted's Excellent Video Game Adventure?
******************************************************

This is a horrible licensed game from 1991.  It stars Bill and Ted, from the
movie Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.  While the movie was funny, this game
is no laughing matter.  This is your last chance to stop playing it...

****************************
Why should I play this game?
****************************

Are you a masochist?  If you really think you'd enjoy this game, and I can't
stop you, you might as well read the rest of this guide to get some help.

***********************************
Can I use this guide on my website?
***********************************
It depends.  Here's how it is:

YOU MUST E-MAIL ME(slodeth@iname.com) AND ASK FOR PERMISSION!  A simple "may I
 please use your Bill and Ted guide on my website(www.wherever)?" will do
 it, but any and all sucking up is appreciated. :)

You may not make any changes to it.  You can ask, but the answer will be "no"
 in almost every case.

You cannot make it seem like you wrote the guide yourself IN ANY WAY.  It must
 be clear that it is my original work.

You may not re-write it yourself in your own style.  It's called plagiarism.
 Even if you change every word, plagiarism is the theft of IDEAS.

****************************************
Is this the latest version of the guide?
****************************************

It depends.  If you got it from my website(go.to/SloDethFAQs) or from GameFAQs
(www.gamefaqs.com), it is the latest public release of the guide.  If you got 
it from www.neoseeker.com(I'm a mod on the boards there, look for me), it is 
probably the latest version, give or take a day.  If you found it at any other 
site, it may not be the latest version.

                            VERSION HISTORY
                           =================

v1.2 - 6/5/01 - Added a piece of ASCII art and changed a little part of the
 email rules.  I know it was pointless, since one was a cosmetic change and I
 haven't received a SINGLE email about this guide.  See, the guide is marked as
 incomplete at GameFAQs, and I'm not sure why...maybe this will change it.

v1.1 - 4/29/01 - Corrected a few things.  Complete, as I see it.

v1.0 - First version.


                           =================
                            THE WALKTHROUGH
                           =================


To start off, this game sucks.  It really, really sucks.  Beating it is nearly
impossible without cheating.  Writing a walkthrough is difficult for this game
because so much of the game is randomly determined.  Because of this, I will do
my best to teach you how to play this game efficiently.  All the wandering
around can really wear you down, especially if you do it aimlessly.

*******************************
I bought this game...what next?
*******************************

When you started the game for the first time, it probably didn't make any
sense.  To explain - a man gives you 15 coins to use on the phone.  Look
through your phone book and find a flashing red number.  Press Select or Start
and dial the number with A.  Now you enter a strange screen with circles,
numbers, and wires.

******************************
I dialed a number...what next?
******************************

When you press A in this place, the elevator shoots out in its current 
direction.  Your goal is to get it to the final digit in the phone number, on
the left side of the screen.  If you leave the elevator on that number, it will
go through the path to the next level.  With the D-pad, you control the red
circle.  Use this to catch the elevator if it isn't going where you want.
Avoid the circles with skulls in them, because they shoot the elevator in a
random direction(usually backwards) and charge you one coin.

In the later levels, the final path does not appear(i.e. the far right is empty
with no continuing path).  You must hit one of the RED skulls to make it
appear, then continue as usual by entering the last circle.

***************************************
I'm in a real level now...what do I do?
***************************************

Here's the story: in case you haven't seen the movie, you must go back in time
to find some famous people.  You appear in an ancient land with no idea where
to go.  There are people to talk to and enemies to avoid.  You're looking for
someone.  You may have figured it all out...but what do you REALLY do?

Your goal in the level is to find a historical persona and bring him/her back
to the future(ha, another horrible licensed NES game!).  To find the persona,
you must first find the correct Bait.  Four Baits are hidden in each level, but
you only need the correct one.  To find this Bait, you must look in certain
places(you get advice on where to look) by either walking around or jumping
onto the correct bush/tree/rock.  Only one of the Baits will attract your
persona...for example, the salad dressing attracts Julius Caesar.

As you run around the level, you meet enemies known as Crazed Jailer Dudes
(CJDs).  These vary in theme from level to level.  If you see a CJD standing
still, walk up to it.  It will either give you an item(Good Stuff, coins, or
even keys) or advice on where to find Bait or a historical character.  If you
see one walking around, don't run into it, or it will steal one of your coins.
If you see one running toward you, get away quickly, or it will send you
straight to jail.

To combat the CJDs, you need some Good Stuff.  To put it simply, these are your
weapons.  Good Stuff comes in four varieties:

1) Pudding Cups - When you throw one, all the CJDs will run straight towards
it.  Once one of the CJDs picks it up, they will come back to get you.  These
aren't very effective, so use them as a last resort.

2) Fire Crackers - If one lands on or near a CJD, that CJD will disappear.  All
the other CJDs on the screen will run away.  This is my personal favorite.

3) Highly Dangerous Textbook - This kills all the CJDs on the screen instantly.
As they say on Celebrity Jeopardy!, the pen is mightier than the sword.

4) Boombox - All the CJDs begin dancing for awhile.  They won't attack you
while the boombox plays.

In the level, you will find an area where you hop in a canoe and ride down the
river.  If you touch the bubbling water, you get an item.  Avoid the rocks and
such.  If you make it to the end, you get a few coins.

As you walk around, you should enter any doors you see.  Inside, you meet some
side characters.  When you talk to them, you have three choices of responses.
Use A to cycle the choices and B to select the choice.  Depending on your
choices, you could get items, advice, nothing, dismissal, or jail time.

Finally, if you get caught by one of the CJDs, you get sent to jail.  It will
take one Key to get out.  If you run out of keys, it's Game Over, dude!

********************************************
How about some advice for individual levels?
********************************************
(note: this is the walkthrough of the guide)

**********************
How about some cheats?
**********************


Well, the level codes are right up there!  Here are some Game Genie codes from
Galoob...

          SZKUPXVK       Infinite skeleton keys
          SZEKUOSE       Infinite coins for locals
          OUOOUEOO       Infinite Good Stuff(tm)
          SXOTTOSE       Phone call segments cost only 1 coin
          OOKKUTIO       Ted starts with 99 coins instead of 15
          OOSVAPIO       Bill starts with 99 coins
          IEKKUTIP       Ted starts with 5 coins
          IESVAPIP       Bill starts with 5 coins

I usually don't condone cheating, but for a horrible game like this, the cheats
are almost necessary.  Believe me...I had to go through the game without them.

Ask me if you can use this guide.  I will almost certainly let you, as long as
   you ask politely.
Don't E-mail me crap.  Don't ask me to join a website, like AllAdvantage.
   I've received way too many of those.
Try to use correct spelling, decent grammar, and capitalization.  I'm not a big
   fan of people who like to freestyle with their spelling...
AOL slang is not up to my standards.  Don't use "r u" instead of "are you" or
   anything like that.  It gets on my nerves.  If you do that thing where you
   cApItAlIzE eVeRy oThEr lEtTeR, don't expect a response.

the boards of the games I've written for.  Also, I'm a mod on the Neoseeker
boards, so look for me there.
