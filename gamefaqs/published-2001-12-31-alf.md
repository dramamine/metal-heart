===============================================================================


******************
What is this game?
******************

This is Alf, an adventure game for the Sega Master System (think NES without the 
popularity) released in 1989.  In case you're old enough to remember it, Alf was 
a terrible sitcom from the 80's with this big talking animal (well, technically, 
he's an Alien Life Form) named Alf.  Fortunately, I don't remember much about 
it.  This is the video game based on the TV show.  I know licensed games like 
this usually suck, and this isn't an exception...but it's much better than Bill 
and Ted's Excellent Video Game Adventure!

***************************
Where can I find this game?
***************************

Well, you can always check www.ebay.com for it, but the game is fairly rare 
these days.  If you're lucky enough to already have a Sega Master System, it's 
at least worth looking for.

However, if you're not willing to shell out some cash for this game, there's 
always the emulation route.  I won't go into detail about it here, since it's a 
shady topic, but you should be able to find all the information you need at 
www.classicgaming.com and www.edgeemu.com.

**********************
Is this game any good?
**********************

Well, it's short, and it's amusing...

*****************************
Why did you write this guide?
*****************************

CJayC over at gamefaqs.com has this contest called the FAQ Bounty...I decided to 
try to pick up the prize on this one.  I'm such a sell-out!


***********************************
Can I use this guide on my website?
***********************************
It depends.  Here's how it is:

YOU MUST E-MAIL ME(slodeth@iname.com) AND ASK FOR PERMISSION!  A simple "may I
 please use your {NAME OF GAME} guide on my website(www.wherever)?" will do
 it, but any and all sucking up is appreciated. :)

You may not make any changes to it.  You can ask, but the answer will be "no"
 in almost every case.

You cannot make it seem like you wrote the guide yourself IN ANY WAY.  It must
 be clear that it is my original work.

You may not re-write it yourself in your own style.  It's called plagiarism.
 Even if you change every word, plagiarism is the theft of IDEAS.


****************************************
Is this the latest version of the guide?
****************************************

It depends.  If you got it from my website(go.to/SloDethFAQs) or from GameFAQs
(www.gamefaqs.com), it is the latest public release of the guide.  If you got 
it from www.neoseeker.com(I'm a mod on the boards there, look for me), it is 
probably the latest version, give or take a day.  If you found it at any other 
site, it may not be the latest version.


**********************
Can I send you E-mail?
**********************

Yes, but PLEASE read the Contact Info section at the bottom of the guide, after
you make sure your question isn't already answered in the guide!

===============================================================================
                           II.  VERSION HISTORY
===============================================================================

v1.0 - 9/3/01 - First version.  Complete, as I see it.


===============================================================================
                            III.  WALKTHROUGH
===============================================================================


You begin the game outside the main house.  Try out the controls: 1 jumps, and 2 
performs various actions, like opening doors.  The D-pad moves Alf, of course.  
If you climb up to the roof, you find that your spaceship (or something) isn't 
working.  "THESE THINGS NEVER SEEM TO HAVE FUEL WHEN YOU NEED THEM," it says.  
Guess you should get some fuel!

Go one screen left, then jump on the counter to get the Cat.  Open the 
refrigerator (with 2) and take "A SALAMI STICK.  JUST THE TICKET FOR THOSE NASTY 
BATS."  Go one screen left.  The left and right doors lead to a bedroom.  You'll 
come back to them later, but for now, "THE DOORS ARE LOCKED.  NO PROBLEMO.  THE 
ALFER WILL JUST GET A KEY."  Go in the center door, which leads to the basement.  
As you walk down the stairs, your Cat will scare off the rats.  Stand under the 
light towards the left, then jump straight up.  Alf says, "LOOKS LIKE THE SECRET 
ENTRANCE TO A CAVE."  Go left and enter the cave.

In this cave, you must avoid the rats on the floor while fending off the bats 
with your Salami (use 1 to strike).  If this part of the game doesn't make you 
quit, nothing will!  To kill the bats, you must line them up almost perfectly in 
front or above your face, then hit 1.  The Salami has very limited range, and 
the bats move quickly.  Patiently try to line up your shots, or just hold Down 
and press 1 frantically.  Stick to the high road whenever you can.  It becomes 
easier on the highest platform in the center, since your range seems to stretch 
to include a large area in front of you.   After that high platform, walk across 
one lower platform, then walk straight left, crossing a bridge to a hut.  In the 
hut, you find "A GOLD NUGGET.  ALF WARBUCKS STRIKES IT RICH ONCE AGAIN HA."  Now 
that you have $50, leave the cave by going back to the entrance.  Jump on top of 
the hut, then continue right.  If you go left instead, you'll die!  Alf says, 
"OOPS.  A DEEP HOLE.  I KNEW I SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT THAT LANTERN."  However, 
dying does send you back to the beginning of the cave, so if you're lazy, just 
kill yourself.

Go back up the basement steps.  You want to go to the General Store now, so 
leave the house out the left exit.  Avoid the bikers and men in suits on the 
street.  The General Store is a few buildings down the street.  It is selling a 
Key for $50, a Ladder for $200, a Fish for $20, and a Costume for $200.  Buy the 
Key.  You can sell your Salami - it's worth $20, and it appears in the shop 
again, so you can buy it back again for $20.  However, you'll want to hold onto 
it, since you go back to the cave later.  Return to the house.

Enter the bedroom by going to the center of the house and entering the door on 
the right.  Open the closet door, and Alf says, "HEY LOOK.  THERE IS A SWIMSUIT 
IN THE CLOSET.  WITH LEGS LIKE MINE I SHOULD LOOK GREAT IN THIS OUTFIT."  If you 
go in the bedroom to the left, you can open the other two doors...but you 
shouldn't!  The one on the left has a bug in it.  Return to the center of the 
house by going right, then go one screen left to the study.  Go in the door here 
to enter the backyard.  Jump in the lake.  If you didn't have a Swimsuit, Alf 
would have said, "NO SWIMMING WITHOUT A SUIT.  THATS NO FUN.  HA.  I WILL HAVE 
TO GET A SWIMSUIT."

It's time for some more action!  Swim down, avoiding a catshark.  You encounter 
a harpooner - these are easy to trick, since they fire as soon as you get near 
their line of fire.  Make the first harpooner fire, then cross over to the right 
side of the screen.  Swim down until you see another harpooner.  Get him to 
fire, then swim down the center path when he moves towards the right.  After 
passing that rock, swim right and get some air.  Swim straight down and get the 
Treasure Chest.  Alf says, "PIRATE TREASURE.  THE ALFER STRIKES IT RICH AGAIN.  
THIS GAME IS BETTER THAN VEGAS."  Go back left and swim straight down in the 
fairly open area.  You encounter two catsharks and two harpooners, so be 
careful.  Get air from the next airhole, then continue swimming down.  You find 
a clam at the bottom.  Wait for him to open up, then swim to him and press 1 to 
grab the pearl.  If you try this when he's closed, Alf says, "OUCH.  THIS OYSTER 
BITES." and you die.  If you do it successfully, Alf says, "A GIANT PEARL.  THE 
ALFER IS RICH.  BUT WHAT CAN I DO WITH IT."  Well, Alf, you could always sell 
it!  Swim to the top, or just kill yourself, and return to the house.

Leave the house through the right exit.  Continue right on the road, but enter 
the Five and Dime when you find it.  The Five and Dime sells an Alf Book for 
$100 and a Lantern for $100.  Sell your Pearl for $100, then buy the Lantern.

If you buy the Alf Book, you see a short story...this is really cool, so I think 
I should tell you about it!  When you exit the store, text boxes pop up against 
a brick background.  They say, "ONCE UPON A TIME, THERE WAS AN ALIEN LIFE FORM.  
HIS HOME PLANET EXPLODED LEAVING HIM STRANDED IN SPACE WITH HIS FRIEND SKIP AND 
HIS GIRLFRIEND RHONDA.

"RHONDA AND SKIP WENT TO MARS.  ALF CRASH LANDED ON EARTH WHERE HE BECAME 
FRIENDS WITH A WONDERFUL FAMILY.  LIFE WAS GREAT...EVEN THOUGH THEY WOULD NOT 
LET HIM EAT ANY CATS.

"THEN ONE DAY ALF DECIDED TO FIX HIS SPACESHIP SO HE COULD VISIT HIS FRIENDS ON 
MARS.  BEING VERY SMART ALF DECIDED TO SELL THE STORY OF HIS ADVENTURE TO SEGA 
SO THEY COULD MAKE IT A GAME.

"THEY DID AND DECIDED THAT IF ANYBODY EVER READ THIS BOOK THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO 
BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME.  SURPRISE...HA"

This was really the turning point for me in the game...those developers sure had 
a good sense of humor.  So, the moral of the story is not to buy dumb items out 
of curiosity.  Go down the street to the General Store, then buy the Ladder for 
$100.  Buy the Fish, if you really want it.  Go back to the center of the house 
and down into the basement.  Follow the same path as you did to get to the 
little hut before, then jump over it and continue moving left.  Stick to the 
high paths each time, or you might end up in a hole.  Eventually, you find 
another hut.  Alf says, "ALRIGHT.  THIS FUEL PELLET WILL POWER MY SPACE 
SCOOTER."  Return to the entrance by walking or killing yourself.  Go upstairs 
(use 2 to get on the steps) and head outside through the right exit.

Climb up the fence on the side of the house to your scooter.  Press 1 at the top 
to blast off into the sky.  It's another action stage!  Hold 1 and fly upwards, 
avoiding the jumbo jets.  This is quite simple...just zigzag upwards to avoid 
the jets.  The sky color slowly changes from light blue to black.  Board the 
Space Station and buy the Spacesuit for $100.  Sell the Salami if you can't 
afford it.  Exit, and continue upwards.  This is much tougher - you have to fly 
upwards, while green meteorites descend towards you and spaceships come at you 
from the sides.  Good luck...and take it slow!  You don't have to hold 1.  
Release it when things get hectic.  When you reach the top, you find a bright 
crescent moon.  When it opens its mouth, land in it.  Alf says, "HEY.  A  
SPACESHIP REPAIR KIT.  NOW I CAN FLY TO MARS TO SEE MY GIRLFRIEND RHONDA.  THE 
ALFER IS ROLLING."

That's it...enjoy the horrible, horrible ending.  I wonder what the seven people 
responsible for this game are doing now...

By the way, my high score on this game is 12400.
