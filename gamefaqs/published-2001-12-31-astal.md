                               I. INTRODUCTION
===============================================================================


******************
What is this game?
******************

This is Astal, one of the only good platformers for the Sega Saturn.  It was 
released by Sega in 1995.

***************************
Where can I find this game?
***************************

Check your local used game stores.  It can be difficult to find, since its name 
is not written on the side of the box!  You'll need to look for a blank space 
where the title should be on the side of the box.

If that fails, look on the internet!  www.ebay.com usually has whatever you're 
looking for.

************************************
What are the controls for this game?
************************************

D-Pad - Movement
A - Bird Action
B - Attack/Action
C - Jump
X, Y, Z - Bird Actions
L, R - Scroll Bird Actions

I go into more detail in the first level of the walkthrough...be sure to read 
it.

**************************************
What's the deal with the Karma system?
**************************************

When you kill certain enemies, or you hurt the various bosses, you receive Karma 
points.  These can be redeemed to make your Bird perform special moves, like 
attacks and health-retrieval.  Learn to use these wisely!  You need to maintain 
a balance between gaining more health and using the Bird for attacks.

****************************************
Explain the deal with two-player mode...
****************************************

Two-player mode really adds a new dimension to the game.  The entire game is 
based around two characters - Astal and his Bird.  The whole point to the story 
is the way they interact and help each other, and how their relationship grows.  
In two-player mode, the first player controls Astal while the second player 
controls the Bird.  The second player can now concentrate on fighting off the 
enemies while the first player concentrates on getting through the level alive.  
It also adds quite a few unique boss strategies...there's plenty to explore!


****************************************
Are there any good secrets to this game?
****************************************

Not really...it's very straightforward, and there's not much to explore.  Try 
pounding the ground  every once in awhile - you may find some special items.

******************
Is this game hard?
******************

It can be very, very hard your first time through, but it's much easier once you 
know all the tricks to the levels.  They can be very creative.  Hopefully this 
guide will make the game easier for you...

**********************
Is this game any good?
**********************

If you like 2-dimensional platformers, this game's for you.  If you hate 2-
dimentional platformers because you think they're all the same, don't 
worry...this one is very innovative.

***********************************
Can I use this guide on my website?
***********************************
It depends.  Here's how it is:

YOU MUST E-MAIL ME(slodeth@iname.com) AND ASK FOR PERMISSION!  A simple "may I
 please use your {NAME OF GAME} guide on my website(www.wherever)?" will do
 it, but any and all sucking up is appreciated. :)

You may not make any changes to it.  You can ask, but the answer will be "no"
 in almost every case.

You cannot make it seem like you wrote the guide yourself IN ANY WAY.  It must
 be clear that it is my original work.

You may not re-write it yourself in your own style.  It's called plagiarism.
 Even if you change every word, plagiarism is the theft of IDEAS.

****************************************
Is this the latest version of the guide?
****************************************

It depends.  If you got it from my website(go.to/SloDethFAQs) or from GameFAQs
(www.gamefaqs.com), it is the latest public release of the guide.  If you got 
it from www.neoseeker.com(I'm a mod on the boards there, look for me), it is 
probably the latest version, give or take a day.  If you found it at any other 
site, it may not be the latest version.


**********************
Can I send you E-mail?
**********************

Yes, but PLEASE read the Contact Info section at the bottom of the guide, after
you make sure your question isn't already answered in the guide!

                           II.  VERSION HISTORY
===============================================================================

v1.1 - 9/2/01 PM - Roughly doubled the size of the walkthrough, on the advice of 
CJayC himself...hope it's good enough for ya!  Unfortunately, the guide doesn't 
look much more detailed...but I can't think of anything else to add.  If I get 
any email requesting help, I'll change the guide to add detail to that 
part...but other than that, I think I'm done with this guide.

v1.0 - 9/2/01 - Fixed the formatting.  Added Cheats and information on two-
player mode.  Played through the game again to make sure I didn't miss anything.  
Decided not to add a Story section, since all the information you need is 
contained in the game or the instruction manual.  I don't want to spoil 
anything...

v0.8 - 9/1/01 - First version.  Done, but not complete.  I still need to fix the 
formatting, add details on the story, maybe add cheats, etc...just wanted to get 
this guide out there.


===============================================================================
                            III.  WALKTHROUGH
===============================================================================



~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~ LEVEL ONE - THE JOURNEY BEGINS ~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~

After you walk forward, some jewel-shaped enemies will jump at you from the 
foreground and the background.  Use your attack for the first time - either grab 
them and throw them(forward + B), or smack them over the head(jump, down + B).  
After that pair, if you continue forward, you will run into a line of enemies.  
For these, you want to use the dash-throw attack(tap forward, then hold forward 
and press B when you get close).  After them, you run into a big tree in the 
road.  Get close to it, then press B to lift it.  Walk forward, then toss 
it(with B) onto the next set of enemies.  After that, you see a fruit on a tree 
- it increases your life by one, so grab it.

In the next cave, you find your Bird in a cage surrounded by ~8 enemies.  You 
might want to try your breath attack(hold up, press B) for this one. Kill them 
all, then continue.  You can now use your bird's special powers.  To explain 
these:

X - Bird flies forward and finds an item (usually a life-restoring fruit) for 
you.  Press X once to make him retrieve it, then press A to make him release it.
 1-3 Karma - finds one Red Fruit after draining all of your Karma.
 4-8 Karma - finds a Green Fruit, which restores your life completely, after 
draining 4 Karma.
  
Y - Bird performs some special action.  This usually is level-specific, such as 
lighting a dark cave or attacking a boss.  It typically costs 4 Karma.

Z - Bird performs an attack.
 1-7 Karma - bounces around the screen at a 45-degree angle, destroying 
everything it touches, for about three seconds at the most.  The more Karma you 
have, the longer the attack lasts.  This attack costs 4 Karma, at the most.
 8 Karma - after using 4 Karma, Bird splits into four and bounces around the 
screen.


(note: if you don't have these three buttons, use L or R to scroll through them 
and A to perform them)


As you continue on, you run into more enemies.  Note that some enemies have 
glowing balls orbiting around them.  If you jump on or kill these, your Karma 
increases by one, up to a maximum of eight.  Your Karma meter is in the center 
of the bottom of the screen.  Karma is used for your bird's special actions.  
You will find one glowing diamond that fills up your Karma bar completely - 
enjoy!  After a few birds, a diamond enemy, and a bee, you run into another 
large plant.  Lift this one, toss it on the group of diamonds and birds, and 
continue forward.

You will run into some enemies that shoot arrows at you - just continue forward, 
avoiding the arrows.  Kill the diamonds and birds and continue forward until you 
find a large, glowing ball.  This will transport you to the next level.


~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~= LEVEL TWO - INTO THE DARKNESS =~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~ 


Walk forward in this dark cave.  The enemies are large, but not dangerous.  You 
run into bees and big rock-enemies at first.  After the first hill, you will see 
a single beam of light, then the screen will go dark.  Some Cyclops bats will 
appear above you, lighting up the room.  These act as a low ceiling - just stay 
below them and you'll be fine.  The Bird's special action option becomes 
available - use it to keep the Cyclops bats off you.  If you don't have enough 
Karma, get to a low place and duck down.  You lose health when you touch them.  
It's a short level, so don't worry about it...just try to learn how to use this 
Karma system.  Near the end, you run into a row of eight of those rock enemies, 
but you can run past them, since they fall from the ceiling.  Up the next hill, 
you run into a row of four diamonds.  Use the dash attack and continue.  The 
next valley contains the exit.


~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~ LEVEL THREE - THE EVIL EYE ~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~ 


This is the first boss level.  One of the cyclops bats decides to make it 
personal.  Attack it using the jump, down + B attack.  Use your Bird's special 
attack when you get the chance.  The jewel in the upper right represents the 
boss' life bar.  About halfway through, the bat starts hopping around towards 
you.  Stay relatively close to him and use the same attack to hit him in the 
eye.

It goes to a cutscene.  I won't describe what happens in these cutscenes...it's 
a very good story with a surprise ending, so I don't want to spoil anything.



~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~= LEVEL FOUR - THE DEEP FOREST =~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~


Watch out for the green water in this level - it hurts!  This level involves 
much more jumping than the previous ones.  Learn how to jump after dashing, then 
practice jumping on the heads of birds to get across longer gaps by holding B 
during the jump.  The level is a bit longer, but it's not very dangerous.  
Decide whether you want to kill the enemy birds or use them for jumping when you 
see them, and you should make it through easily.

After the first four simple jumps, the platforms start towards the top of the 
screen.  Be careful...during the second next jump, a bird dashes at you in mid-
air.  Wait for it to pass, or just kill it.  In the next jump, two birds float 
up and down.  You can't jump completely over them, so you need to jump on the 
second bird's head by holding B.  The next jump has two birds moving at 
different rates, and the platforms are farther apart - jump across both their 
heads.  In the next jump, two birds move up and down in the same vertical line - 
smack the one on top and jump.  The next difficult situation comes when three 
birds in a vertical line come at you - smack the one on top again, then kill the 
bird flying half a screen behind them.  This fomation appears again soon after.  
For one jump, you can grab a fruit halfway under the platform by jumping on the 
bird's head at the correct time, but it's unnecessary.  After three more simple 
bird-jumps, you run into a line of FIVE birds between two platforms.  Slowly 
jump across each one.  After that, you find a platform with one fruit and three 
birds flying above it.  You meet the first demon (brown guy with one long arm) 
here - if he grabs your Bird, kill him quickly, or your Karma will start to 
drain.  After a pair of rock enemies, you must bird-jump over three largely-
spaced birds to cross.  Get up some speed before you jump.  The end is very soon 
after that.


~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~= LEVEL FIVE - THE RIVER OF DREAMS =~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~ 


In this level, you ride this dragon through a river.  Birds fly above you, and 
you can jump on top of them to reach high items.  Note that you can pound the 
dragon (down + B) to make him lunge forward and attack enemies in front of him.  
Use this if he ever stops moving to get him to start again.  It also flings you 
in the air, if you want those higher items.  This knowledge comes in handy in 
the beginning...you can grab a fruit and avoid a few plants.  The plants come 
alone in the beginning, so you can simply jump over them.  About halfway 
through, the dragon just stops moving.  If you have enough Karma, have the Bird 
retrieve an item - it will be an extra life.  Pound his back and continue 
onwards.  Jump over two plants, then duck to avoid the next one.  Kill two lines 
of birds, then jump over two plants, then duck under the next.  After that, you 
can use the birds like steps to avoid plants and grab a fruit.

Then, the dragon goes crazy, since it's trying to eat a certain fish.  Learn to 
time your jumps perfectly.  You won't get flung in the air if you jump before it 
recoils, but you might want to be flung to avoid obstacles.  The more control 
you have in this section, the better.


~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~ LEVEL SIX - THE FOREST FIEND =~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~ 


A boss so soon?  This time, it's a giant flower.  It tries to attack you by 
darting at you - just slam him.  When he releases seeds, you can uproot the 
flowers to keep them from hurting you.  While they grow, slam the ground to 
force the big flower down to your level, then slam him.  About halfway through, 
his roots turn into legs.  He ducks down more often in this stage, so you have 
more opportunities to hit him, even if it's more difficult to avoid his attacks.  
After a few more hits, the level ends, and another cutscene kicks in.


~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~= LEVEL SEVEN - VOLCANIC VALLEY =~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~ 

At the start of this fiery level, you use your breath to blow out some 
fire...you might want to remember to do that!  Blow on all the fiery enemies and 
sprouting flames in this level before you proceed.  In the beginning, you run 
into a flame, a rock-enemy, another flame, then a flaming seasnake.  Blow out 
the rock enemy after that, then jump on his head to reach the next fruit.  Jump 
over the next two flames.  You then run into a line of seven seasnakes - blow 
out the ones in front of you, but run from the ones behind you.

After that, the camera zooms out, and little rocks from the volcano start 
exploding when they hit the ground.  Be patient, and try to stand in safe places 
as they fall.  Birds flying above you add to the difficulty of this secion.  It 
becomes much easier when you reach a giant rock...pick it up and use it as a 
roof to the end of the level.  You toss it onto the top of a volcano.


~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~ LEVEL EIGHT - GUARDIAN OF FIRE ~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~ 


To harm this fiery dragon, wait until his head separates from his body, then 
blow out the flames on his body.  Toss the bones.  The only difficult part of 
this is avoiding the flames from his head.  When he soars in from the 
foreground, stay in a corner and duck to avoid the flames.  The battle ends 
after about three tosses.


~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~ LEVEL NINE - SEA OF CLOUDS ~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~ 


This is the first truly difficult level.  It involves some seriously difficult 
jumps with enemies at every turn.  The Bird's special action causes the 
platforms to temporarily freeze, so use it wisely.  Note that you can blow many 
of the enemies out of your way, even the spiky ones!

Jump across the rocks to the first moving platform.  Ride it up, blow away the 
spiky enemies, then jump to the next platform.  Jump across the rocks until you 
find three birds - use them as steps to get up to the fruit if you can.  If you 
fall, don't worry...just hop across the next two moving platforms.  After that, 
you find three moving platforms cascading horizontally upwards.  Patiently hop 
up them, then let the top one carry you across to the next rock.  The next 
moving platform after that is tough...unless you can use your Bird's special 
action.  Since it quickly goes up and down between two spiky enemies, it can 
kill you if you stand on it too long.  The Bird will freeze it in the middle, so 
you can take your time waiting for the next platform to come from the right.  Of 
course, this one is near the end, so it's almost home free after that one.  
Follow the simple moving platforms until you can see the exit.  Blow away the 
enemy, then wait for the platform to rise completely to the top.  Take a leap of 
faith to the exit.


~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~= LEVEL TEN - THE BEHEMOTH =~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~ 


This is a giant goat-like enemy.  It sticks its horns into the ground as it 
approaches you.  Wait for an opening, then dash-attack him.  You can also dash-
attack him while he rushes at you, but he usually jumps over you.  Five tosses 
will kill him.  The Bird's special attack is very effective, but you won't even 
need it.  A cutscene kicks in, and the game continues...


~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~ LEVEL ELEVEN - GLACIAL RIFT ~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~ 


This level is filled with avalanches, slippery surfaces, and tricky hopping 
enemies.  Sound tough?  Well, it's not...the hardest part is in the middle.  
After five avalanches and six hopping enemies, you exit the first cave.  After a 
mess of jumping and crawling enemies, you will come across a long, elevated ice 
platform.  You'll know you find it when you see a bird flying straight at you.  
The platform crumbles after you step on it, so dash across it.  Jump over the 
first few birds.  When they appear in pairs, you need to slam-attack them and 
quickly move on.  You can dash through all the other parts of this level...there 
are only two avalanches, two holes in the ground, and a few enemies.


~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~= LEVEL TWELVE - THE CRYSTAL PALACE =~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~ 


Another fairly straightforward level.  Go forward, then jump across the 
platforms, avoiding the spikes.  The camera zooms out.  Jump down to the 
platform below, then jump across to one that's lighter than the rest.  It begins 
falling...many of the icy platforms in this level are weak.  When you step on 
them, they begin to fall forward, taking you with them.  This can be a good 
thing, once you figure out the timing of your jumps.  If you can't stay high on 
these platforms, just walk around the bottom, avoiding the spikes.  You'll have 
to do some tricky jumping at the end with a flock of birds if you fall.  When 
you reach the end of the first big "room," climb to the top and follow the path 
downwards, avoiding the spikes descending from the ceiling.  At the end, when 
you reach magma at the bottom, have your Bird do a special action, which knocks 
the stalactites down from the ceiling, creating a path.


~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~= LEVEL THIRTEEN - FROSTBITE!! =~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~ 


For this boss, Astal gets trapped, so the Bird must save him!  The controls are 
pretty simple...the control pad moves the Bird around, and B attacks.  If you're 
close to the enemy, press B rapidly to slap at it.  If you're farther away, hold 
it down and release to dash-attack.  When it swings around, stay low.  When it 
turns into a cyclone, stay high or low to avoid him.  When it just sits there 
right after an attack, dash in and start slapping at Astal.  Five attacks should 
kill him.  Another cutscene cuts in.


~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~ LEVEL FOURTEEN - THE PLAINS OF DESTINY ~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~ 


This is a very strange level.  In the beginning, you encounter a giant bug.  As 
you go under him, a few of his legs lift up.  Stay under these lifted legs.  The 
legs switch off, creating a safe little bubble under him.  Stay inside this 
bubble until you can finally come out the other side.  It moves forward a large 
distance, backward a large distance, forward halfway, forward one step, then 
forward to the exit.  Kill two enemies, then go under the next bug.  You can 
tell which legs are going to stomp down by the way they move.  The stable legs 
are safe, so stand under them while the others lower.  Go forward by one set of 
legs after they stomp down until you reach the end.  After that worm, start 
running.  You encounter a flurry of diamond enemies...jump on or over enemies 
instead of killing them whenever you can.  After awhile, the worm will start 
chasing you.  Eventually, you will reach four jumping enemies.  A giant jewel 
kills the bug, and one of the main bad guys in the game appears in the 
background.  He throws giant jewels at you, but for some reason, they can't hurt 
you.  Continue forward, letting the jewels kill any tough enemies.


~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~ LEVEL FIFTEEN - DESTINY UNFOLDS ~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~ 


Time for another boss!  This level reminds me of the battle with Knuckles at the 
end of Sonic 3.  You regain control on a small platform.  Don't run off either 
side of it, or you will die.  When the camera zooms in, the boss is about to 
toss a jewel at you.  Pick one side, then dash to the other after it's thrown.  
The jewel always hits either the entire left or right side, so choose wisely.  
When three orbs create a prism, avoid standing under them.  After two or three 
prisms, the boss grabs them and tosses them horizontally at you - jump over 
them.  Attack him before this happens if you can.  When four orbs float above 
you and create lightning, stand under the holes when you can, then attack the 
boss when he descends.  If you have your Bird do a special action, he will 
destroy all but one of the orbs, and the boss will descend.  This gives you the 
opportunity to dash-attack him.  

Halfway through the battle, the platform will ascend.  This time, the boss 
summons five orbs in a hemisphere on either the left or the right side.  Move to 
the opposite side, then dash-attack the boss if he descends on your side.  Jump 
on or over the orbs as he tosses them towards you.  When he dashes toward you 
with a jewel-drill, try to jump above him, then slam him as he rises.  Watch 
another cutscene...this one reveals the true boss of the game.


~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~= LEVEL SIXTEEN - THE FIGHT FOR THE FUTURE =~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~


The boss appears in the background with jewels orbiting around him.  When the 
jewels stop, the front one spawns a dragon. * Jump over it, dash-attack into it, 
or let the Bird do his special action.   When he gets closer to the screen, he 
does a punching attack.  The fist always lands lined up with the middle of his 
body, so jump to the sides.  When you get the hang of it, you can actually slam-
attack or dash-attack his hand to hurt him.  When he simply tosses a jewel at 
you, let it land on the ground in hopes that it will spawn the plant. If it's a 
plant, grab it, then hold Up and toss it when the boss is lined up with it.  If 
it's a rock instead, stay away from it.  Later on, he will do the fist-attack 
while you're holding the plant - hold onto it until you can toss it at him WHILE 
THE JEWELS SPIN AROUND HIM.  It's hard to avoid his fists, since you move so 
slowly.

That's it!  Enjoy the ending.

===============================================================================

Want to start the game with an advantage?  You'll need two controllers for this 
one, and at least one must have the X, Y, Z, and shoulder buttons.  Go to the 
Options menu with the first controller.  Then, on the second controller, press 
Left, Right, Left, Right, Up, Down, L, R, then Start.  You'll hear a chime, and 
Secret Mode should be enabled.  You can now increase the number of lives to 99.

After enabling Secret Mode, you can also enable a Level Select option on the 
main menu.  Go to the Options menu and press Up, Down, Left, Right, L, R, A, Y, 
C, Z, B, then X.  Back on the main menu, you can choose from any of the 16 
levels.


There are two cheats that can be performed during the game.  The first of these 
makes you invincible - pause the game and press Up, Y, Left, A, Down, B, Right, 
then C.  This won't prevent death by falling, so you still need to be cautious.  
The next cheat refills your energy bar - pause the game and press Down, R, Up, 
L, X, A, Y, B, then Z.

And remember...the game is always more fun if you play it WITHOUT CHEATING!

E-mail Rules:
Don't ask me questions that are already answered in the guide!  Search for it
   before you email me!  It will save you AND me some time.
Make sure you are reading the most updated version of the guide.
Include the name of the game or guide in the subject.  Astal is enough.
E-mail me just about ANYTHING: questions(not answered in the guide), comments,
   praise, constructive criticism, requests...
Ask me if you can use this guide.  I will almost certainly let you, as long as
   you ask politely.
Don't E-mail me crap.  Don't ask me to join a website, like AllAdvantage.
   I've received way too many of those.
Try to use correct spelling, decent grammar, and capitalization.  I'm not a big
   fan of people who like to freestyle with their spelling...
AOL slang is not up to my standards.  Don't use "r u" instead of "are you" or
   anything like that.  It gets on my nerves.  If you do that thing where you
   cApItAlIzE eVeRy oThEr lEtTeR, don't expect a response.

ICQ Rules:
Do whatever you wish.  I don't care about ICQ very much.  Put my number on spam
   lists, tell it to your friends, and flood it with whatever you want.

If you're looking for me on a message board, you'll probably find me on the
GameFAQs boards.  I go to the FAQ Contributor board the most often, and I visit
the boards of the games I've written for.  Also, I'm a mod on the Neoseeker
boards, so look for me there.
