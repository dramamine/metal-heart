*****************
What is Neutopia?
*****************

Neutopia is a blatant Zelda-ripoff for the Turbo Grafx16(or whatever it's
called in the rest of the world).  It is still a great game, albeit unoriginal.
I only heard about it because CJayC over at GameFAQs.com put a bounty on
writing an FAQ for it.  After playing it, I must say that it is one of the
best classic games I've played!

**************************
Where can I find Neutopia?
**************************

The best way is to buy it!  Check your local used game stores and see what you
can find.  Check some online stores and see if you can find it there.  I don't
think FuncoLand has any, but they charge too much anyway!  The best place to
look is probably eBay.  I've seen it go for between $5 and $30.

The other way is to download yourself a ROM of it.  ClassicGaming.com should
provide all the information you'll need for that.  DO NOT E-MAIL ME about ROMs
or emulation.  I'm not against it that much, but I don't want to deal with it.
You can find any information you need online.

***********************************
Can I use this guide on my website?
***********************************

It depends.  Here's how it is:

YOU MUST E-MAIL ME(slodeth@iname.com) AND ASK FOR PERMISSION!

You may not make any changes to it.  You can ask, but the answer will be "no" 
 in almost every case.

You cannot make it seem like you wrote the guide yourself IN ANY WAY.  It must
 be clear that it is my original work.

You may not re-write it yourself in your own style.  It's called plagiarism.
 Even if you change every word, plagiarism is the theft of IDEAS.

If I grant you permission by E-mail, you should give me an E-mail address which
 I can inform you about updates to the guide.

If I grant you permission by E-mail, you should give me a hyperlink to the web
 site on which you post the guide.

****************************************
Is this the latest version of the guide?
****************************************
It depends.  If you got it straight from my website, it is the latest version.
If you got it from GameFAQs, it might be a day or two behind, but this is 
probably the best place to turn.  If you got it from any other website, you
might not have the latest version.

Since this is a classic game, I probably won't need to update the guide very
many times.

**********************
Can I send you E-mail?
**********************
Yes, but PLEASE read the Contact Info section at the bottom of the guide FIRST!


=========
1. BASICS
=========

Yes, this game is a Zelda clone.  I don't think anyone can deny it.  Playing
Zelda(the very first one) will prepare you for this game like nothing else.
The strategies you use are very similar.  Most of the following advice could
be applied to Zelda also.

Whenever you see something suspicious, bomb it!  There are hidden caves and
passages just about everywhere.

Whenever you enter a room, kill all the enemies.  When you're travelling on
the land, you can avoid the enemies if you wish, but it is more dangerous and
you won't get any gold/prizes.  In the dungeons, killing all the enemies in
many, many rooms will open doors.

Whenever you see a rock, try to push it!  Moving rocks can open doors and
secret passages.

Use your shield wisely.  If a projectile is about to hit you, turn to face it.
Your shield can block most projectile attacks.

Always try to carry two doses of the Medicine of Vitality.  You don't really
need to spend your money on anything but Medicine.

Don't put yourself into dangerous situations.  For example, don't try to attack
a large horde of enemies at once.  Wait until one separates from the pack, then
kill it.

As with all RPGs(if you can call this one), SAVE OFTEN.

Here's a list of the items you can receive from killing enemies...
Silver Coin-worth 10 gold.
Gold Coin-worth 50 gold.
Cherry-refills life by one box.
Wings-use it to return to the Shrine.
Bombs-blow stuff up.
Hourglass-every enemy freezes for awhile.


-------
PREFACE
-------

In this guide, I will explain the quickest way to get through the game.  I will
not list the locations of all the shops, people, and gifts.  I will not mention
any walls you can bomb through unless it will honestly save you some time.
There are places to bomb EVERYWHERE...any time you see something peculiar, try
placing a bomb.

Also, I would like to say that the difficulty of this game is PERFECT.
Beginners will use this guide to help them find the next area or such, and
experts can find it with just a little more effort.  There are people
everywhere in the game ready to hand out their advice, cryptic as it may be.
For maximum enjoyment of this game, I recommend you only use this guide when
absolutely necessary.  However, if you want this guide to hold your hand
throughout the game, I've got you covered too.

Now, on with the walkthrough!



==================
2. The Land Sphere
==================
When you begin, you are given a Magic Compass.  This compass, whenever you are
on the World Map or in a Labyrinth, will point(the red end) to the source of
evil.  People throughout the game advise you to use this constantly!

----------------
To Labyrinth One
----------------

Go south once and go down the stairs.  A man will give you a Book of Revival
(hold UP against the chest for a second to open it).  This item allows you to
receive passwords and use the File Cabinet, if you have the right hardware.

Go west once and enter the cave.  This man gives you Boom Bombs and Medicine
of Vitality.  To use either of these, press Run and highlight the one you wish
to use.  You can equip one item at a time.  The bombs are used to blow up any
secret entrances, pathways, and such.  They can also be used as an offensive
weapon, but be careful-you can only hold eight at a time.  The Medicine of
Vitality completely restores your health.  A green jar indicates you can use
it once more, while a red jar indicates you can use it twice.

Go west, north, west, northx4, east, north, then west.  A woman in the cave
will save your game.

Go north, then east.  Here is the first labyrinth!

--------------------
Inside Labyrinth One
--------------------

Go east, northx2, then eastx2.  Kill all the monsters and push the stone aside.
Inside the chest is the Crypt Key.

Go westx3, then north.  Here is the Crystal Ball.

Bomb the east wall and go east.  Go north, then west.  Here is the Bronze
Armor, which will increase your defense.

Go east, north, east(bomb), east, then north.

BOSS: Attack him with your sword.  Wail away on him for awhile, until he
quits wiggling.  Move away to avoid his fire, and move back in when it's clear.
Repeat until he dies.  Then, head north and get your first Medallion!

----------------
To Labyrinth Two
----------------

Go south, east, north, then east.  A boy down the stairs will give you 100
gold.

Go west, south, eastx3, then northx2.  Kill the slime and push the lower right
stone.  Go down the stairs and you receive the Fire Wand from a monk.  This
item shoots fire, which harms enemies and burns various things in the
environment.  Try burning down trees and such whenever they seem out of place.
Also, it has three different firing powers.  If your vitality is very high, it
shoots a flame that slowly goes in a straight line, causing a good amount of
damage to any enemies it encounters.  If your vitality is medium, it fires a
flame that returns to you, like a boomerang.  If your vitality is low, it fires
the same flame, but it won't return.  Note that you can fire this weapon
diagonally...this will come in handy.

Go west, north, west, north, west, north, west, northx3, west, then south.
Bomb the mural here.  The man inside will raise your vitality by one!

Go north, east, south, eastx3, southx2, east, then north.  Here is the second
labyrinth.

--------------------
Inside Labyrinth Two
--------------------

Go northx2, north(rock on right), east, east(rock in middle), north, then
north(bomb) to find the Crypt Key.

Go southx2, eastx3, then south to find the Bronze Sword.  This will increase
your attack power.

Go north, west, then north to find the Crystal Ball.

Go south, west, southx2, west(bomb), then north to the boss.

BOSS: Wait for him to burst, and avoid the shards.  The best places to
stand are directly west, east, or south of him.  Swoop in and attack the blob
once or twice, then run away.  Repeat until dead.  Go north and receive the
second Medallion.

==========================
3. The Subterranean Sphere
==========================

I'm pretty sure I missed a bomb capacity upgrade in this Sphere.  If you find
it, please e-mail me(slodeth@iname.com) about it.

------------------
To Labyrinth Three
------------------

* UPDATE * To get a bomb upgrade, go westx2, then south.  Kill all the ants,
then take the stairs.  This was sent in by Zatos.

Go northx6, then west.  Burn the crystal on the left and go down the stairs.
This elder gives you the Moonbeam Moss.  This item lights up dark areas, so
use it in any room that is too dark to see.  There will be rooms like this in
every dungeon to come.

Go east, south, west, southx2, west(through the middle path), north, north(on
the left path), then north to reach the third labyrinth.

----------------------
Inside Labyrinth Three
----------------------

Go north, east, then south.  Kill all the enemies and push the leftmost stone
out of the way.  Get the Crystal Ball.

Go northx3, then west.  The elder here gives you the Bronze Shield, which
allows you to block some more powerful projectiles.

Go east, north(bomb), north, westx2, northx2, then east(2nd leftmost rock on
bottom row) to find the Crypt Key.

Go west, southx2, west, then north to find the third Boss.

BOSS: These two gargoyles fire swords in eight directions every once in a
while.  Luckily, your new shield can block these.  Try to corner one of the
gargoyles while the other one flies elsewhere.  Once you kill one, the other
should be simple.  Go north and get the third Medallion.

-----------------
To Labyrinth Four
-----------------

Go northx6, eastx3, south, eastx2, southx6, westx2, then north.  Move the rock
in the upper left, and go down the stairs to find the Rainbow Drop.  This item
allows you to cross water hazards which are only one block wide.

Go south, west, north, west, north, east, north, south(on the right), then
east to find the fourth labyrinth.

---------------------
Inside Labyrinth Four
---------------------

Go northx2, westx2, then south.  Kill all the enemies, then push the 2nd
rightmost rock in the center row.  The elder is to the east, and the Steel
Armor is to the west.  To get the armor, you must travel on the lower path,
getting burned by the fire all the while.  It is possible to time it so that
you don't get burned, but it's quite difficult.

Go east, north, north(bomb), east(bomb), then north(bomb) to find some Medicine
of Vitality.  It's not necessary, but hey, it's worth quite a bit of money.

Go south, then eastx2.  Avoid the arrows while you cross the pit to get the
Crystal Ball.

Go west, north(leftmost rock), north, north(right rock), then north(bomb) to
find the Crypt Key.

Go southx3, eastx2, then northx2 to reach the boss.

BOSS: The easiest way to kill this guy is to attack all his segments at once.
Try to attack him into a corner, then wail on him until all his parts explode.
Go east and get the fourth medallion.

===================
4. The Water Sphere
===================

-----------------
To Labyrinth Five
-----------------

Go east, south, south(on the right side), south, westx2, south, and west.
This place is a bit complicated.  If you go north on the right side, you'll
find a monk who will send you to the Shrine for 50 gold.  See the bomb-able
cave door?  You want to go there, but you can't go there directly.  Go west
over one platform, then north to the next screen.  Wrap your way around the
area until you reach the cave.  Inside, you'll find the Steel Shield.

From this cave, go west, then northx2.  If you burn the lower left stone here,
you'll find a lady that will cure you.  After stopping here, go north(on the
right side), westx3, then north.  Bomb the cave here.  Kill all the enemies
inside, then go northx2.  Talk to Orian here, and push the red rock.  Go
southx2 and exit the cave.  Go southx2, east, southx2, west, then north.  This
is the fifth labyrinth.

*I spent about twenty minutes trying to find this place.  One man says that
Orian is north of here, yet another man says north isn't always north...it was
all very cryptic.*

---------------------
Inside Labyrinth Five
---------------------

Go west, northx2, west, then north(bomb).  Here is the Crystal Ball.

Go south.  You can go west(bomb) and north(bomb) to find some more bombs if you
want, then return.  Go east.  You can go east, then north to get even more 
bombs if you want, then return here.  Go north.  If you want, you can go east,
east(bomb), then east to get Medicine of Vitality, then return here.  Go
north, eastx2, north(lower right rock), north, east, then north.  In here,
kill the two worms, then push one of the rocks in the upper right.  Get the
Crypt Key.

Go south, westx2, then north.  Grab the Silver Sword.

Go south, east, southx2, westx2, north, west(bomb), then north to the Boss.

BOSS: You can only harm this crab when his eyes turn white.  The best way to
kill this guy is to stay in the upper corner(either one).  Attack him whenever
his eyes turn white, and stay in your corner otherwise.  If he comes near you,
move down out of his range, but STAY AGAINST THE WALL.  He won't do his
vertical attack if you stay against the wall.  While your Vitality is high,
try using the Fire Wand.  Since the flame stays around for awhile, it will
burn the crab quite a bit.  When he is finished, go north and get the fifth 
Medallion.

----------------
To Labyrinth Six
----------------

From the shrine, go east, northx3, west, north, then westx2.  Kill all the
enemies here, then go down the stairs.  An elder will give you Falcon Boots.
These boots allow you to walk much faster, and they're very fashionable!

After leaving the cave, go west, south, west, north(on the left), west, south,
south(on the left), south, west, then northx3.  Enter the sixth labyrinth.

--------------------
Inside Labyrinth Six
--------------------

Go north, westx2, then north(bomb).  Kill all the enemies, then push one of
the rocks in the upper left to find the Crypt Key.

Go south, east(rock on left), eastx2, then northx3.  Grab the Crystal Ball
here.

Go north and go down the stairs.  Go up the stairs on the other side.  Go
northx2, north(rock on right), north, east, then south(bomb).  Kill the
enemies here and push away a lower left rock to get the Strongest Armor.

Go north, eastx2, then south.  Kill all the enemies and push the rock in the
lower right.  You can go east(bomb) then east(bomb) to pick up some Medicine
of Vitality, then return and go down the stairs.  Go up on the other side.
Kill the monsters here and go north to the Boss.

BOSS: This one's pretty easy.  Hit the heads when they float away from the
body.  Just stay away from the body and hit any heads that come near, and you
should be fine.  Once all the heads are dead, go north and get the Sixth
Medallion.

=================
5. The Sky Sphere
=================

------------------
To Labyrinth Seven
------------------
Go north, eastx2, then south.  Bomb the cave here.  The monk here allows you
to carry four more bombs.

Go north, westx3, southx3, eastx7, north, west(lower path), west, northx2, 
east, then south.  Enter the seventh labyrinth.

----------------------
Inside Labyrinth Seven
----------------------

Go north, west, north, east(lower left rock), east(upper right rock), and take 
the stairs.  Come up on the other side.  Go south, then westx3 to find the 
Crystal Ball.  Go back to the intersection(eastx3, north, stairs, westx2).

Go northx2, north(bomb), then north.  Kill the enemies and look at the three
rocks on the upper left side.  Push the two outside ones in and push the
middle one to the side.  Grab the Crypt Key.

Go south(once inside the rocks, press the top upper right stone north and the
one next to it east), south, eastx2, north(lower right rock), east(start by
pushing southernmost rock on the right, southernmost rock on the left, push
the other lower left rock up, push northernmost rock on left in, push other
rock aside, push southernmost rock in the upper right in, and leave room),
east, south(bomb), then south.  Grab the Strongest Shield and get out of there!

Go northx2.  You can grab some bombs by going north(bomb), then return.  Go
west, then south(bomb).  Kill the mummy, then get to the stairs.  To do this,
look at the three rocks on the left side.  Press the middle one in(right), then
press the top one out(up).  Go down the stairs and come up on the other side.
Go north, west(rock on right), south(rock on left side of cross), west(rock
in lower left corner), then north to the Boss.

BOSS: This guy can be tough.  Run around while he floats, and attack while he
takes the shape of a robot/man.  If the crystals or their shots hit you, you
take damage.  Try to attack his arms at the exact moment when the crystals
have floated inwards.  You should get the rhythm after awhile.  It only takes
a few hits, but they can be very hard to pull off successfully.  Go north and
pick up the seventh Medallion.

------------------
To Labyrinth Eight
------------------

Go north, west, southx3, eastx4, southx3, east, south, then west.  Bomb the
cave here.  The monk inside will increase your Vitality bar by one.

Go east, north, west, northx2, then eastx3.  Take these stairs.  Go eastx2.
If you bomb the cave here, you'll find Medicines of Vitality and Boom Bombs.
Go east, south, south(on right path), west, northx2, westx2, south, east,
then north.  Enter the final labyrinth!

----------------------
Inside Labyrinth Eight
----------------------

Go westx3, then north.  Once you kill all the monsters, a set of stairs will
open up.  Take this to the other side.  Go east, then south(bomb).  Here you
will find the Bell of the Sky!  This item reveals secret stairways.

Go north, west(kill ALL the enemies once, or use the Bell), west, then down the
stairs(rock in the lower right).  Come up on the other side.  Grab the Crystal
Ball.

Go east(upper right rock), east(right rock in the middle), east(bomb), then
north.  Kill the zombie here.  Take the stairs on the right, and come up on
the other side.  Go north(rock on left), west, west(rock on left), west(bomb),
then west(bomb).  This sage increases your vitality by one.

If you want Medicine of Vitality, go eastx2, then south(bomb).  Mess with the 
southernmost rocks and you'll open up a set of stairs.  Take these stairs to 
the other side. 

Return to the entrance of the labyrinth.  Go eastx3, then north.  Kill the
enemy here and take the stairs on the left.  On the other side, go south(bomb)
and grab the Crypt Key.

Go north, east, then south(bomb).  Take the stairs here to the other side.
Kill all the enemies and go north to fight the Boss.

BOSS: This guy is tough.  You can only  attack when the head splits and reveals
him.  Watch for the patterns and attack only when it is safe.  Use Medicine
of Vitality whenever necessary.  When you finish, go north and down the stairs.
Grab the final Medallion!

=============
6. The Finale
=============

------------------
Final Preparations
------------------

Before you finish up, you'll need the Strongest Sword.  From the Shrine at
the Sky Sphere, go north, west, southx3, eastx4, southx3, east, south, then
east.  Use the Bell, then take the steps.  Enter the structure here and grab
the Strongest Sword.  Either walk or use Wings to return to the shrine.

Also, you should stock up on Medicine of Vitality, if you don't have two doses
already.  The quickest way is in the Land Sphere.  From the shrine, go south,
eastx2, north, west, south, then east.  The woman in the cave sells one dose
for 200 gold.  Return to the shrine.

------------
Final Battle
------------

Now it's time to take Dirth down!  Go northx2 and enter the portal.  After the
welcome speech, step back.  He fires that circle of blue flames once-avoid it.
He disappears and reappears with an illusion of himself by his side.  Try to
position yourself in between them.  When one of them disappears, wail on the
other one.  Ignore the flames-if you take damage, you take damage.  Repeat this
over and over.  Use your Medicine whenever your health gets low.  If you have
the two vials of Medicine, you should have no problem with this boss.

The alternative to this method is more conservative.  Stand in between the two
Dirths and hit the real one only ONCE.  Then, step back and avoid the flames.
This will take much longer, and it's really not necessary.

Once you defeat him, congratulations!  You beat the game!  Watch the credits 
roll.  It's a pretty good ending, considering it came out in 1990.
