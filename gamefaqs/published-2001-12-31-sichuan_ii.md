What is this game?
******************

This is Sichuan II, a Mahjong/hentai arcade game released in 1989 by Tamtex.  It 
is also known as Shisensho - Joshiryo-Hen.


*************
What is MAME?
*************

MAME is an acronym for Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator.  To sum it up, it is a 
program which can run ROMs, or arcade game files, allowing you to play thousands 
of classic, nearly extinct arcade games on your own computer.  Check out 
www.mame.net for more info.

The intent of the program is to preserve a piece of video gaming history.  
Unfortunately, this puts it on shaky legal ground.  While MAME itself is 
perfectly legal, it is illegal to own ROMs for arcade games which you don't own.  
However, like owning copyrighted MP3s, it is very unlikely that you will get in 
trouble for owning ROMs.  I personally feel no remorse for owning illegal ROMs, 
since the original developers can no longer profit from the game, and it is 
impossible to find these games in real life without some serious trouble.  I 
feel different when it comes to MP3s - almost all music is easy to legally 
obtain.

*********************************
What do I need to play this game?
*********************************

First, you need the latest release of MAME - grab it at www.mame.net.  Follow 
the simple installation instructions.

Next, you need the ROM file for Sichuan II(sichuan2) or one of its 
clones(sichuana, shisen).  I can't legally tell you where to find it(cough, 
edgeemu.com, cough), but if you fire up your favorite search engine, you should 
have no problem finding it - search for MAME, rom, and the name of the game.  
When you download it, unzip it in the correct folder([folder where you installed 
MAME]\[name of zip]) - mine is C:\MAME\zookeep.

If you have any further problems with MAME, don't ask me about it - read the 
Help files and the FAQ on mame.net for the answers!  It's not too hard to 
understand if you READ THE INFO FIRST.


***********************************
Can I put this guide on my website?
***********************************

Yes, you may...this guide may be fully distributed, zipped with other files, and 
even printed out, as long as it isn't edited or sold.  Don't change it, and 
don't sell it!  The latest version of the guide will always be posted at 
www.gamefaqs.com.

This is one of many, many Mahjong variations straight from Japan.  Luckily, it's 
a simple one - even I can understand it!  I determined most of this info by 
trial-and-error.

You start out with a grid of tiles on the board.  These tiles all have various 
pictures on them, ranging from 1-9 dots to peacocks to flowers to seasons to 
Japanese letters.  Your job is to eliminate the tiles, one matching pair at a 
time.  However, you can't pick any two tiles...you must follow one simple rule 
when finding pairs: you have to be able to connect the two tiles with one 
continuous line that bends only twice.  I'll explain with
some pictures...pretend the letters are tiles, spaces are spaces, and the dashes 
are the lines drawn.

     dr    qm             dr/---qm            /-dr--\ qm  
     mx----xa             mx|   xa            | mx  | xa  
     dfqa  rf             dfqa  rf            \-dfqa\-rf 
                                                 |     |
                                                 \-----/ 
 
 a straight line        line bends once       lines bend twice

In this situation, the x, q, d, f, and r pairs will all work...however, the m 
and a pairs wouldn't work, since a line with three bends is required.  These 
pairs will be valid when you eliminate the pairs around them - for example, the 
m will be free once you remove the two d's.  You can use this elimination to 
remove all the tiles from the board.

Once you understand the rules, it's a matter of scanning the tiles and looking 
for pairs.  It gets harder as more tiles are added, since more tiles aren't open 
immediately.  The hardest part is starting...

Start by looking at the board one side at a time.  Look for matches on just one 
side.  After removing one of these pairs, look at the tiles that are now 
available to use, and see if you can find any matches with these new tiles.  
Remember that you can't even make matches from one side to another until you 
start eliminating the corners - this will make more sense once you start 
playing.

If you get stuck mentally, and you realize that you're wasting too much time, 
just use a Hint.  You have three of them for each round, and the bonus for not 
using them is small.

If you want to use more advanced strategy when removing the tiles, remember that 
wach picture has about four tiles to match it...therefore, the most obvious 
pairs are not always the wisest.  See, the game can possibly reach a deadlock, 
like this one(very simple, I know...I'm not creative):

   abc
   dede
   cba

There's a deadlock...you can't do anything with those tiles!  Now, pretend that 
the board once looked like this...

   abcbbcc
   dedeaa
   cbaddee

As you can see, grabbing the obvious pairs ends in deadlock.  Of course, it will 
be much more complicated in the actual game...

So, that's how you play this tile game!



As for the game itself, it begins with a menu of four choices of girls.  After 
you pick one, you go through three rounds(one level) of tile puzzles.  After you 
complete each one, you see another more revealing picture of the girl.  After 
that, you do the same with the other three girls.  Level five and six don't give 
you a choice, and that's the end.  The puzzles become more difficult as you 
progress until the entire screen is filled with tiles.

You have a HINT option in the game.  Three times per tile layout, you may use it 
to point out a pair.  Use this when you can't see any pairs on the board.

The game is running on a time limit, so be quick!  This becomes more and more 
difficult as the game progresses.

Insert the following lines into the cheat.dat file in the base MAME directory:

sichuan2:0:EA06:99:000:Infinite Time
sichuan2:0:E181:00:001:Finish this stage Now!

sichuan2:0:EA48:09:000:Infinite Turn Time PL2

If there is no cheat.dat file yet, create one in Notepad.  If you are using a 
ROM file other than sichuan2, change "sichuan2" above to "sichuana" or "shisen".  
To activate cheats in the game, hit TAB and use the arrow keys to explore the 
menus.
