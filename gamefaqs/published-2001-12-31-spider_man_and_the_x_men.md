************************** I.  Introduction/FAQ *******************************

==================
What is this game?
==================

This is an action/platformer game starring Spiderman and the X-Men.  Arcade has
captured the X-Men, and Spiderman must save them!  Sorry, I'm not a big fan of
either of them, so I can't elaborate...

This is a very difficult game, but I'm sure this guide will make it easier!  It
is far from impossible, especially if you follow my advice.

=============================
Why did you write this guide?
=============================

CJayC over at www.gamefaqs.com put up an FAQ bounty on it.  I decided to write
up this guide and make a little cash for it.

========================================
Can you explain the basics of this game?
========================================

When you start the game, you control Spiderman.  You must collect the capsules
and get to the exit.  After that, the game really opens up.  You can choose
between any of five characters, although you must beat both levels for each
character.  This system is much like the system used in the Megaman game.

=========================================================
Which is better, the Genesis or SNES version of the game?
=========================================================

The SNES version.  The graphics are much better, the controls are quicker, the
screen shows more of the level...in fact, it's easier because of the control
and HUD changes!

========================================
Is this the latest version of the guide?
========================================

It depends.  If you got it from my website(go.to/SloDethFAQs) or from GameFAQs
(www.gamefaqs.com), it is the latest public release of the guide.  If you got 
it from www.neoseeker.com(I'm a mod on the boards there, look for me), it is 
probably the latest version, give or take a day.  If you found it at any other 
site, it may not be the latest version.

If you're reading this, the guide is probably the final version.  Everything
relevant to the game is in the guide right now, and nothing new is usually 
discovered with old games like this one.

===================================
Can I use this guide on my website?
===================================
It depends.  Here's how it is:

YOU MUST E-MAIL ME(slodeth@iname.com) AND ASK FOR PERMISSION!  A simple "may I
 please use your Spiderman guide on my website(www.wherever)?" will do it, but
 any and all sucking up is appreciated. :)

You may not make any changes to it.  You can ask, but the answer will be "no"
 in almost every case.

You cannot make it seem like you wrote the guide yourself IN ANY WAY.  It must
 be clear that it is my original work.

You may not re-write it yourself in your own style.  It's called plagiarism.
 Even if you change every word, plagiarism is the theft of IDEAS.


======================
Can I send you E-mail?
======================
Yes, but PLEASE read the Contact Info section at the bottom of the guide first!


************************** II.  Version History *******************************

v1.0 - April 29, 2001 - Added the intro and ran it through the spell-check.

v0.9 - April 24, 2001 - First version.  The walkthrough is complete, so
technically this is a full guide...that FAQ Bounty is MINE!  Soon(I promise,
it's high-priority), I will flesh it out so the guide isn't so abrupt and 
empty.  I wrote this guide in only two full nights, so I apologize in advance
for any problems with it...give me at least a week before you criticize it.


************************* III.  The Walkthrough *******************************

          ==================   INTRODUCTION   =======================          


Controls:
 B - Jump
 Y - Fire
 X - Web(shoot web diagonally, allows you to swing across gaps - press up and
      down to retract the line)


In this level, you must collect the capsules in a certain order.  Your Spidey-
Sense points to the next capsule in the sequence.  This level gives you a nice
introduction to the game, with few enemies and a simple level layout.

Start by killing the machine in front of you, then hop up the windowsills to
the first capsule.  The second is on the ground, near that machine.  For the
third one, jump up to the third platform and stand on the edge.  Use the web
to swing across...take this time to learn how to swing properly.  Holding right
during the swing will get you across this gap, but be sure to try holding up
and down to master swinging for when it's more dangerous.  After you get the
hang of it, cross and grab the capsule in front of you.  Fall down the gap, go
forward, then climb the walls to get to the fourth capsule above you.  Take
this time to master climbing, too.  Go back down and collect the fifth capsule.
The sixth capsule is at the top of this shaft.  Go to the exit to the left and
jump up to the seventh capsule.

Go back to the platform, then swing across.  Get to the roof of the building
and kill the machine.  Swing across to the right(hold up during the swing) and
grab the eighth capsule on your way to the building.  This place has many
caverns in it, so slowly fall down the shaft.  After you grab capsules 9-11,
get into the cavern to the left.  It contains capsules 12 and 13.  Fall 
straight down the shaft to the bottom and collect capsules 14 and 15.  Go back
to the next cavern above you.  Kill the machine(or run past it) and continue
going left.  Keep on following the path(left, down, then right) until you find
capsule 16, then retrace your steps and collect 17-19.  Return to the bottom
floor and go all the way right to find capsule 20 and the exit.


          ==================   Spiderman One   ======================          



Go forward and climb the wall.  Shoot the machine and cross.  Swing across,
following the path of the brown spiders.  Fall down and kill the machine.  Jump
to the platform to the right, then swing a small ways across to the next 
platform.  Climb up to find two red spiders if you wish, then return.  Grab the
heart under you and continue forward.  Keep on going until you reach the wall,
then climb on up.  Swing across to the left until you can exit the room.  Go up
and go all the way right.  Be sure to stay up high and swing forward, or you'll
have to retrace your steps.  When you reach a wall on the right, climb all the
way up to find an extra life.  Go all the way down and go right.  Climb on up
and zigzag your way up.  When you have to enter a narrow path to the left, get
ready for a tough enemy.  He jumps and shoots thick lasers.  Kill him to
receive five hearts.  

Continue left and down.  When you reach the left edge, start going upward.  At
the top, go right to the end.  In the final room, you meet a red bat with a
blue stone in its hands.  Fire at it like a maniac.  When it moves around, it
leaves red stones that give you points and slightly restore your health.  If
your help is somewhat high, this won't be a problem at all.  Fire away and jump
to the red stones when you can.  The level is complete when you defeat it.


          ==================   Spiderman Two   ======================          


Make your way up by swinging on the various platform.  Directly to the right is
a bottomless hole, so don't fall in!  When you reach the top, continue going
right.  Soon, it will start to rain.  You will now have problems with the
wind...the rain shows you if the wind is blowing left, right, or not at all.
Plan accordingly.  This area doesn't have a bottom platform, so be careful and
stay high.  When you leave the area(it stops raining), continue right.  When
you see the spider path leading to the next building, stand on the edge of your
building and fire your web, then hold down.  You'll use this technique a few
more times on this level.

After you pass two steel vertical pillars, the castle has an extra life near
the bottom.  Be sure to grab it before you move on.  At the far right is a
boss.  To kill the red guy, get him trapped against a wall and fire away.  If
you can't pull this off, just kill him one shot at a time.  When he's finished,
you must take out Rhino on the bottom.  To harm him, you must swing into him
using your web.  The best strategy I have found to kill him is to stand 
directly under the middle of the middle platform on the bottom.  If he 
approaches from the left, shoot your web left and swing into him, then
immediately shoot and swing back right when you land.  This will score you two
hits, and you only lose health once.  The level ends when he dies.


          ==================   Wolverine One   ======================          

Controls:
 B - Jump
 A - Use Claws
 Y - Jab
 X - Uppercut
 

Wolverine is unique in his ability to regenerate health.  When you kill an
enemy, it usually leaves a heart to restore you.  To use the claws, press A.
Repeat to retract them.  While in use, you have longer range with your weapon.
While retracted, you slowly regenerate your health.  I recommend keeping your 
claws active for most of the game.


Go across the level to the right wall.  The clowns near the end respawn, so
move on.  To kill the Jack-in-the-Boxes, jump on their box and jab away until
they die.  Jump up and zigzag your way up.  When you reach a downward path with
an extra life to the left about five floors up, don't go down.  Grab the extra
life and continue going up.  On the next floor, you'll need to destroy your
first wall - just punch through it and continue up.  This level is very
simple...you just continue zigzagging to the top of the level.  At the
top is a blue boss with long arms.  Hit and run works very well against him.
Try to uppercut him each time he lands, and you'll finish him off quickly.


          ==================   Wolverine Two   ======================          

It took me a long time to conquer this level because the solution seems so
inefficient.  You must kill this red enemy, and it will take a long time.  His
speed is based on your speed, so take it slow.  Use hit and run techniques
rapidly - take a swipe, take a single step forward, and repeat.  Cut the ropes
on all the obstacles(weights and anvils) to harm him even more.  Jump across
all the pots and holes in the environment.  When you reach a wall, take a break
from harming the boss and destroy the wall with four quick uppercuts.  Do this
throughout the stage before the big pot at the end and you'll win!


          ===================   Cyclops One   =======================          


Controls:
 A - Kick
 B - Jump
 C - Use Visor

Go forward and kill the soldier.  Wait for a cart to appear, then hop in.  At
the next station, climb your way to the top and you'll find a large ruby
guarded by four soldiers.  Go back down and hop in the next cart, which appears
to be running backwards.  Follow it to the end and go down the path.  Continue
going right, and stay as high above the electric rail as possible.  When you
reach a safe, open area with a few of the circular enemies, grab the big ruby
above you and return.  The large platform in front of you can crush you, so
carefully run under it and back to trigger it.  Jump on top of it and continue
onward.  If you reach a right edge, travel up and left to find an extra life.
Go down until you find another cart, then ride it to the end.  Be sure to shoot
up at any falling spikes and down at any spherical bombs.

At the end, you'll find the first enemy that can't be destroyed by your visor.
You'll need to kick him to death, then hop in the next cart.  Stay in the cart
until you see a soldier in another cart, then jump off to the platform.  Kill
the enemies around you and proceed.  A ruby is protected above you, but the
rest of the level is through the small hole.  Follow the path down the hole
across another cart path and down again.  This time, when you reach a cliff
with no platforms in sight, jump down and hug the cliff wall.  You'll land on
a platform that gives you access to another cart.  Hop in and follow it to the
end, where you find a big blue boss.  Shoot away at him and avoid his shots; it
should be simple.  Jump across the platforms to the right to the exit.


          ===================   Cyclops Two   =======================          


Follow the path forward, as usual.  There is little danger here, since the
electric tracks are far under you.  When you find some tracks further into the
level, just follow the platforms over them.  When you reach the blue boss, kill
him in the same way and continue on.  The exit is nearby.

But wait!  There's a final boss!  This guy is much tougher.  Start by standing
on the platform.  Shoot any missiles that come near you, jump to avoid the
various projectiles, and shoot his arm when you can.  When his arm falls off,
step to the lower platform and shoot diagonally up at his shoulder.  Stand in
the sweet spot(you shoot down all the missiles and his shoulder without moving)
until he jumps.  Move under him and try to shoot at his head.  When he jumps
back, find the sweet spot and repeat until dead.




          ====================   Storm One   ========================          

Controls:
 A - Use Lightning
 B - Use Tornado
 C - Use 8-Way Lightning

Shoot the clam to your right to grab a whirlwind.  Destroy the capsule to raise
the water level.  You'll need to shoot all the capsules in this level, so get
each one you see.  Go left, down, and shoot the wall to your right.  Go right 
through this tunnel and up on the other side.  Continue along the path.  When
you reach a dead end in the upper left corner, DON'T shoot the capsule yet!
Dive back down and go up the next path on the right.  The water level wasn't 
high enough before, but now you can get this capsule.  Return to the upper left
corner, then go through the left door.  Go up and get air, then dive back in
and get the capsule you missed.  Go back left and up, then follow the path to
some more air.  Skip the one in that tunnel if you must.  The rest of the level
is straightforward until the end.  You'll see a yellow-green spinning orb on
the right side of the screen.  Go to the top so you can breathe, then shoot
away at the orb.


          ====================   Storm Two   ========================          


Kill all the enemies in the immediate area before you hit the capsule.  Take
the exit to the right.  When you get to the room with the strange glass 
machines, you've found the boss.  Grab some air at the top(you should leave at
least one capsule available) and dive near one.  When the flame enters the
glass, fire a bolt straight into it to destroy it.  Repeat until you've 
destroyed all the capsules under the water.  Go get the last capsule(there
should be one to the right in a little cavern, but get any others you missed
too) and return to get the rest of the glasses.  The level ends when all the
glasses are destroyed.


          ===================   Gambit One   ========================          


Controls:
 A - Throw Card
 B - Jump
 C - Use Special(fireball surrounds you for ~5 seconds)

Gambit's levels are very straightforward.  You must make it to the end of each
level at the right side of the screen.

-If you collect 100 stars, you get an extra life.

-If you kill an enemy, it turns into a card, which will increase your 
ammunition(the second red bar).  Yes, your ammo is limited, but don't let it
make you nervous.  Ammo is plentiful.

-The B item restores most of your ammo.

-A spiky wheel is rolling towards you constantly.  Keep up the pace, but don't
let the wheel scare you.

-You don't have to kill each enemy.  Your health is very valuable, so use every
opportunity you can to avoid encounters.

-Destroy those yellow blocks by shooting them multiple times.

When you get to the end of the first level, you meet a giant playing card boss.
Stand directly under him and fire a bunch of cards upwards.  When he 
disappears, be prepared - he shoots out bolts that generate monsters when he 
reappears.  Stand under a platform and shoot up to destroy some of the enemies,
then start shooting at him again.  When he disappears, kill any other enemies
he previously generated.  Repeat until dead.


          ===================   Gambit Two   ========================          
 

In this level, you scroll upward instead of right.  In the first area where the
path splits, take the left path.  In the next one, take the second to the
right(shoot up to kill those pawns).  To kill the boss, you must take out her
arms first.  Use all your special attacks first to damage both the arms at 
once.  Notice how there is a deck of cards on each side of the screen.  Use up
all your cards first by shooting her arms(stand under one) until you run out,
then grab a deck.  Near the end, you'll need to use each card effectively or
you'll be stuck with no way to kill her.  Be careful!


          ===================   TRANSITION   ========================          

NOTE: I haven't gone into too much detail with these levels because of their
simplicity.  If you could beat the first eleven stages, these should be NO
PROBLEM.

Cyclops - This is simple.  Go forward and take out any soldiers in your way.
Jump past anyone that gives you trouble.

Wolverine - Activate your claws.  Go along the path, killing any toys and
jumping when necessary.  Again, this shouldn't be a problem.

Gambit - The hardest part about this stage is the jumps.  To make the first
one, ignore the knight and do your best to make the jump.  The next difficult
jump is just a leap of faith.  The enemies aren't tough if you stay
patient.  There isn't a wheel chasing after you, so take your time!

Storm - This is a bit different, but still easy.  Do your best not to collide
with the enemies and you'll do fine.
Controls:
 A - Shoot Water
 B - Jump
 C - Use Whirlwind(like Gambit's special)

Spiderman - Do the usual zigzagging to the bottom of the level.  Take your time
or rush through it...it's pretty simple.


          ===================   FINAL BOSS   ========================          

This isn't much to worry about.  This boss is easier to defeat than some of the
bosses in the first levels, IMHO.


First Attack:  A clown-robot rolls slowly forward and backward.  Shoot away at
its head, but jump to avoid any bombs.

Second Attack:  Now, he bounces on a spring and launches more bombs.  Shoot
away, but try not to touch him too much.

Third Attack:  Now, he rolls quickly on the ground, shooting multiple bombs.
Be more cautious with him.  I recommend crouching on the middle platform to
fire at him.  When he dies, you get a few hearts.

Fourth Attack:  A bunch of men in white suits with guns hop out.  Kill them
one-by-one.  They are taller than they seem(i.e. the game is a little messed
up), so try shooting above their head.  There are two waves of four men each.
This is the last attack, so enjoy the lame ending!
