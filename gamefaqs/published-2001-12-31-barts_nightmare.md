******************************* I. Intro/FAQ **********************************

******************
What is this game?
******************

This is Bart's Nightmare.  In this game, Bart Simpson falls asleep and his
homework blows out the window.  You must go and retrieve it!  This is my
favorite game of all the Simpsons games on the SNES.

*****************************
Why did you write this guide?
*****************************

Well, I liked the game, and it was pretty high on the GameFAQs request list, so
I went ahead and did it.  Besides, I had nothing better to do!


****************************************
Is this the latest version of the guide?
****************************************

It depends.  If you got it from my website(go.to/SloDethFAQs) or from GameFAQs
(www.gamefaqs.com), it is the latest public release of the guide.  If you got 
it from www.neoseeker.com(I'm a mod on the boards there, look for me), it is 
probably the latest version, give or take a day.  If you found it at any other 
site, it may not be the latest version.

If you're reading this, the guide is probably the final version.  Everything
relevant to the game is in the guide right now.

***********************************
Can I use this guide on my website?
***********************************
It depends.  Here's how it is:

YOU MUST E-MAIL ME(slodeth@iname.com) AND ASK FOR PERMISSION!  A simple "may I
 please use your Bart's Nightmare guide on my website(www.wherever)?" will do
 it, but any and all sucking up is appreciated. :)

You may not make any changes to it.  You can ask, but the answer will be "no"
 in almost every case.

You cannot make it seem like you wrote the guide yourself IN ANY WAY.  It must
 be clear that it is my original work.

You may not re-write it yourself in your own style.  It's called plagiarism.
 Even if you change every word, plagiarism is the theft of IDEAS.


**********************
Can I send you E-mail?
**********************
Yes, but PLEASE read the Contact Info section at the bottom of the guide, after
you make sure it's not one of the questions below!

==============================
GAME-RELATED QUESTIONS(the FAQ)
==============================

*****************************
I can't get so-and-so page...
*****************************

This is a tough game.  I've written everything I can here to help you out.  If
you have some specific question to ask me, go ahead, but don't say, "I'm stuck.
Help me!"

***************************
How do I maximize my score?
***************************

Points in this game are infinite.  You can get them ANYWHERE.  If you're 
looking for the fastest/easiest place to get points, head to the second page of
the Yellow Door.  The boss spews flames, which give you 100pts each.  Step out
of range of the boss and shoot only the flames(yeah, you need a plunger gun or
an extinguisher).  Repeat until you have enough.

*********************************
hey man, do u no any cheat codes?
*********************************

The rest of the guide is written to help you beat the game without cheating.
If you really need cheat codes, look somewhere else!

*********************************
hey man, where can i get the ROM?
*********************************

Go ahead, e-mail me and ask.  You'll regret it.  Do ya feel lucky, punk?


************************** II.  Version History *******************************

v1.1 - April 24, 2001 - Changed Jimmy Neutron to Smilin' Joe Fission.  If
 anyone knows where I got the name "Jimmy Neutron" from, PLEASE tell me!  It's
 the $64,000 question!  Thanks to Patrick O'Leary for pointing this out.

v1.0 - April 22, 2001 - First version.


************************* III.  The Walkthrough *******************************

===============================================================================
                                 THE STREETS
===============================================================================
                          
To get to the mini-games and the pages of your paper, you must roam the streets
to find them.  On the streets, you will encounter many frustrating obstacles.
As you progress in the game, you will find more and more of these objects.

                                Items
[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bubble Gum - Use this to blow a bubble that floats across the screen.  If you
hit a blue Z with it, the Z enters your life bar.

Watermelon Seeds - These are your only weapon.  Use these on TVs or any enemies
that you can't avoid.

Z's - Every time you get hurt, you lose one of these.  They can be collected by
hitting a blue Z with a Bubble Gum Bubble or by skateboarding.  You can hold up
to 28.  If you have no Z's and you get hit, you wake up and the game is over.

Pillows - These are like continues.  If you lose all your Z's, they create
another small bar of Z's for you.

Soda Can - Use this to destroy all obstacles on the screen.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------]

                                Enemies
[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basketball - When you jump over this, it turns into a skateboard.  Riding the
board grants you points, Z's, and speed.  Use this to scan for papers quickly.
Avoid ALL obstacles, cracks, and manholes.

Blinky - Jump over this fish to kill it.  He's worth 250pts, and he's not even
very hard to kill!

Fairy Lisa - When she dumps pixie dust on you, you turn into a frog.  Find an
Old Lady to cure this ailment.  If you get trapped in a gang, Lisa will turn
the gang members into frogs to save you.  Move up or down to avoid her.

Gang - If you touch them, they carry you off.  Jump up and hit a saxophone
flying over your head, then Lisa will appear and turn these guys into frogs.
It's hard to avoid them, so use a watermelon seed if you can.

Head - This is the head of the statue, which seems to be present in most of the
games.  Jump over these to kill them for 60pts.  They usually travel in packs,
so use a series of short jumps to get them all.

Mailbox - These cross the street, trying to hit you.  If you jump over them,
sometimes they turn into items, like Cola and Pillows.  If it turns into a
question mark, touch it and follow the arrow.

Old Lady - She blows kisses at you.  These stop you in your tracks for a second
as a human, but cure you as a frog.

Principal - He slaps a suit on you.  It makes you invulnerable, but at the
price of speed.  Don't run into him unless you're very low on health.

Puddle - This will slow down if you walk into it.  It wears off in under a
minute.

Saxophone - This flies around and drops notes.  If you touch the notes, you
start walking backwards.  This can be annoying, so do your best to avoid them.
Jump up and touch the sax, and it will fly away.

School Bus - It could appear in either lane.  Stay in the middle of the street
or on the sidewalks.

TV - He runs quickly across the screen.  You can't kill him(except with seeds),
so avoid him instead.

Hoo boy.  This is the part of the game that EVERYONE complains about because,
well, it's very tough.  It requires some serious strategic planning and
thinking, which is sometimes impossible because of the enemies.

Some general advice before the detailed maps:

-Grab those dinosaur eggs quickly!  They are your life!  Have one in your
 possession at all times.
-When you see a Devil, you might as well try to kill it.  Don't mess around
 with the green Devils, though...they can kill you.
-If you see a path that you can't get through, go backwards and try to open
 up a path.
-Watch the background!  Be cautious below Maggie.  To avoid her pacifier,
 either jump very quickly to the right(dangerous) or take each block one at a
 time, in the bottom row if possible.

E - egg appears here(100pts each)
* - Maggie launches a pacifier when you get close enough.
S - You must step here to raise an X-block to proceed.
X - You can't step here, or you'll die.
1 - Jump here, then quickly jump right three more spaces.
2 - Once you get to the 19th row five rows after this place, go back a few
    spaces, go up two, left to this pillar, down two, then all the way right.
3 - When you get here, go down three(to set off the pacifier), go right, up,
    then go right all the way to the exit.

* - Maggie launches a pacifier when you get close enough.
S - You must step here to raise an X-block to proceed.
X - You can't step here, or you'll die.
1 - To get through here, hop around the top two rows until you've raised the
    blocks in the bottom row.  Use these blocks; cross one-by-one until the
    pacifier shoots out(this happens at point 1).  Head straight up from here.
2 - After going up from 1, go right ten spaces to 2.  (note: the map between
    1 and 2 is mostly incomplete, because it is irrelevant.
3 - Stand here to let the pacifier safely shoot past you.


If you could get both of these pages, congratulations!

===============================================================================

Controls:  
 B - Jump
 A - Fire
 D-Pad - Move

This is a classic side-scrolling beat-em-up inside the Itchy and Scratchy Show.
Grab a weapon(hammers, fire extinguishers, and plunger guns, from least to most
range) and pound on them!


Point Table
---------|----------------------------
100pts   |   Itchy(hammer)
100pts   |   Scratchy(hammer)
100pts   |   Bazooka Itchy
100pts   |   Bazooka Bullets
100pts   |   Flamethrower Scratchy
100pts   |   Flames(from the flamethrower)
200pts   |   Light Bulbs(from the lamp)
100pts   |   Vacuum
100pts   |   Knife Itchy's Knife
200pts   |   Knife Itchy
200pts   |   Chef Scratchy
2000pts  |   Stove Boss
100pts   |   Stove Flames
10pts    |   every non-fatal hit to the stove


***   PAGE ONE:   ***

Round One:  Grab the hammer on the table to your right.  Pound Itchy, Scratchy,
Itchy, Scratchy, then Itchy.  Nail Bazooka Itchy, then Scratchy, then 
Flamethrower Scratchy.  Go right.

Round Two:  Stay low.  Run past the exploding phone and the Vacuum until you
see a fire extinguisher on a table.  Grab it and take out some of the Vacuums.
When you can, shoot the bulbs coming from the lamp on the table.  They turn
into extra lives, so be sure to get up to four extra lives.  After that, the
bulbs are worth 200 points.  Once you kill seven Vaccums, Itchy, Scratchy,
Itchy, Itchy, then Scratchy, go right and up the stairs.

Round Three:  Start by going right and grabbing the plunger gun.  Kill eight 
Vacuums, Bazooka Itchy, Flamethrower Scratchy, Bazooka Itchy, then Flamethrower
Scratchy.  You instantly enter the next area.

Round Four:  This one is tough.  You are in a kitchen with a slippery floor,
cans rolling around the floor, and a phone that tries to trip you.  Go left
until you get out of range of the soda cans.  If you still have the plunger
gun, you're in luck; just shoot rapidly, alternating left and right.  If you
only have the hammer, jump on the counter and play defensively.  Only jump down
when either Knife Itchy has disarmed or Chef Scratchy is in close range.  Kill
two Chef Scratchies, Knife Itchy, Chef Scratchy, two Knife Itchies, Chef
Scratchy, then one final Knife Itchy.  You win a piece of your paper.


***   PAGE TWO:  ***

(note: unlike in the other mini-games, you must find another page in the street
to access this game)

Round One:  Go right, carefully jumping over Scratchy's tongue.  Grab the
plunger gun and shoot five Vacuums.  Go left, jumping over the tongue and going
past Homer's picture on the wall.  Shoot three Vacuums, Bazooka Itchy,
Flamethrower Scratchy, Bazooka Itchy, then Flamethrower Scratchy.

Round Two:  It's the kitchen again, except this time the sinks release soap
bubbles that harm you(note: they can be destroyed easily with the plunger gun,
but they aren't worth any points).  Go left and kill two Chef Scratchies, Knife
Itchy, Chef Scratchy, two Knife Itchies, Chef Scratchy, and Knife Itchy.

Round Three:  Be sure to get a few lives by shooting the bulbs from the lamp to
your left, then go all the way to the right to get an extinguisher.  Kill
Itchy, Scratchy, Itchy, Scratchy, Itchy, Bazooka Itchy, Scratchy, then 
Flamethrower Scratchy.

Round Four:  Back to the attic.  Kill eight Vacuums, Bazooka Itchy, 
Flamethrower Itchy, Bazooka Scratchy, then Flamethrower Itchy.  Now it's time
for the boss!  Go to the right until you find the stove releasing fireballs.
To defeat it, step about 2/3 a screen's length away from the stove and destroy
the line of flames, then step in and hit the stove itself(note: if you still
have the extinguisher, find the sweet spot where the cloud rests on the grate
for the longest time, doing 50pts damage with each shot).  Repeat until dead.


==============================================================================
                               GREEN DOOR
==============================================================================

***   PAGE ONE   ***

Controls: 
 X - Eyes shoot forward, to take down jet planes.
 B - Eyes shoot down, to take out the tanks on the road in front of you.
 A - Eyes shoot the background (only for points).
 Up - Mouth fires the buildings in the background(only for points).
 Right - Mouth fires the helicopters coming for your head.
 Down - Mouth fires the lower buildings and helicopters.
 Left - Stop moving.

This game is tough.  You play Bartzilla, ravaging through the town.  The only
thing truly hard about this game is the controls.  Good luck figuring them out.
If all else fails, just press Right and A constantly, then Right and Y when a
jet plane flies by the bottom of the screen.  Also, press Down to take down the
lower helicopters early.  This isn't necessary, since they aren't a threat
until they reach the upper half of the screen.  About fifteen hits will take
you down.  You advance when a tank comes by and shoots you with a strange
energy ray...


***   PAGE TWO   ***

Controls:
 D-Pad - Move Around
 Buttons - Electrify!


This level is much simpler.  Move up this huge skyscraper, avoiding the various
people who attempt to drop objects on your head.  The skyscraper gradually
narrows by two windows until it is only two windows wide.  At the top of the
tower is a King Kong Homer.  Climb to the window right by him and use your
attack to kill him(your attack is more powerful if you don't use it until you
reach the top).  For every object you hit, you lose 30 points.  To avoid the
Marge Fly, just stay low until she passes.


=============================================================================
                               BLUE DOOR
=============================================================================

Controls:
 B - Use Slingshot
 D-Pad - Movement

In this mini-game, you take control of Bartman, the flying superhero who
defends the free world with his handy slingshot!


Point Table
-------|----------------------
10pts  | every non-fatal hit against anyone
100pts | rockets
100pts | little red ships
500pts | purple scrolls, if your life bar is full
200pts | Krusty balloon


200pts | Boss One: The Twins

To defeat the first boss, just stay low and avoid the water balloons.  Get up
high and shoot down the balloon when the balloon is on the right sign of the
screen.

200pts | Boss Two: Barney

Barney is riding a purple elephant, which shoots out clouds of poisonous gas.
This is a pretty simple battle if you stay up high and let your bullets rain
down on the elephant.

500pts | Boss Three: Smithers

Smithers flies a blimp that shoots rockets at you.  Again, stay high and let
your bullets rain down on the blimp.  The rockets take out half of your health,
so be careful!

500pts | Boss Four: Smithers Again!

This time, kill him quickly, because he will escape after he fires off all his
missiles.  Note: to make it through the poisonous clouds before this boss,
stick to the lower path.

1000pts| Boss Five: Monty Burns

Mr. Burns flies around in his plane across the screen, trying to shoot you
down.  To kill him, stay in the lower right corner until you can hear him
approaching.  Go up and left, rapidly pressing B.  He will run into your
bullets, which slowly float in his path.  This works when he approaches from
the left AND right, except you may need to start moving earlier when he comes
from the left.


===============================================================================
                               PURPLE DOOR
===============================================================================

Controls:
 D-Pad - Movement
 B - Use Plunger

This is my favorite mini-game of them all, mostly because it's so simple.
While traveling through a blood stream, you must use your plunger to kill the
various germs.  Touch six of the Smilin' Joe Fission guys to free another sheet
of your homework.  This level won't be hard as long as you avoid the germ 
attacks.


Point Table
---------|------------------
50pts    | green germ
75pts    | blue germ
100pts   | orange germ
125pts   | whitish purple germ(pretty fast)
250pts   | red germ(pump it and it explodes, killing all other germs)
500pts   | grabbing Smilin' Joe Fission
-10pts   | a germ escapes after you latch on(i.e. you get attacked)
-25pts   | Smilin' Joe Fission escapes to the top of the screen
-100pts  | getting hit by a germ


Each germ comes in two "flavors": one has a spiky head and charges upwards at
you.  The other tosses little grenades at you that can instantly kill an
unprotected Bart.  Good luck!
