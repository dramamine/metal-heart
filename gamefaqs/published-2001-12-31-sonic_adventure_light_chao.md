0.  Introduction
----------------
									       
I wrote this guide to help all those people out there breed themselves a Light
Chao in Sonic Adventure.  I know somebody would share the secret with the
world, so why shouldn't it be me?  The other guides I've seen were a bit hard 
to follow, so I wrote it all out in plain English.  Any suggestions for this 
guide are welcome, just E-Mail me at slodeth@iname.com.

***********************************
Can I use this guide on my website?
***********************************
It depends.  Here's how it is:

YOU MUST E-MAIL ME(slodeth@iname.com) AND ASK FOR PERMISSION!

You may not make any changes to it.  You can ask, but the answer will be "no" in
 almost every case.

You cannot make it seem like you wrote the guide yourself IN ANY WAY.  It must
 be clear that it is my original work.

You may not re-write it yourself in your own style.  It's called plagiarism.
 Even if you change every word, plagiarism is the theft of IDEAS.

If I grant you permission by E-mail, you should give me an E-mail address which
 I can inform you about updates to the guide.

If I grant you permission by E-mail, you should give me a hyperlink to the web
 site on which you post the guide.

Yes, but PLEASE read the Contact Info section at the bottom of the guide!

----------
1.  Basics
----------

So, we've got these things called Chao.  They're the little blue creatures that
run around.  I'm not trying to write a complete Chao guide here, so I'll keep
this short.

First, find a Chao egg.  There are four different eggs: blue(normal), gold, 
silver, and black.  Gold is from Station Square, Silver is from Mystic Ruins, 
and Black is from Egg Carrier.

Next, you must evolve your Chao.  A Chao evolves when it is given animals from 
the Action Stages.  The way it evolves depends on the animals it is given.  
Each animal will give the Chao some of its characteristics.  After a Chao 
receives enough of a certain type of animal, it will surround itself with an 
egg and evolve,  e.g. if you give it mostly red animals, it will evolve into a 
Dragon Chao, etc.  There are five colors: red, yellow, purple, green, and blue.
Blue affects Chao randomly, so there is no "blue" chao.  
This leaves four once-evolved Chao.  

RED    =   Power
BLUE   =   Running
YELLOW =   Swimming
GREEN  =   Flying


After this first evolution, it can evolve a second time.  Although it will not
form an egg this second time, its appearance will change.  Again, you have an 
opportunity to choose which type of animals to give it.  Each combination of 
colors gives a different Chao, e.g. Yellow first and Red second makes a Sumo 
Chao.  There are sixteen different twice-evolved chao.


Is that it?

Of course not.

There are other types of Chao, one being the Light Chao, which is not created 
from the above method.  I wrote this guide to explain how to get one of these 
with simple, basic instructions.

*NOTE* The Light Chao is also known as the Chaos Chao and the Light Chaos Chao.
The change in name happened during the translation from Japanese.  I will refer
to it as the Light Chao because Chaos looks like the plural form of Chao.


--------------
2.  Light Chao
--------------

***************************************************************
Summary:  Have a Chao reborn twice and then give it 15 animals.
***************************************************************

Starting Out:
Find a Chao egg.  You can create the Light Chao from any color egg, but you may
want to start with a regular blue egg straight from the garden.  If you do not
have any eggs left, you can use a Chao that has not been given any animals.

If you want to reset your Chao gardens, and therefore replacing all of your
Chao with new eggs(six total), you can delete the 23-page Chao Data VMU file.
It will not affect the rest of the Sonic Game in any way.

NEXT STEP:  Have It Reborn

*NOTE* There are several ways to do this, but I have only listed the quickest
way here.  Alternatives include raising it in the VMU, feeding it LifeNuts,
and just waiting.

If you have just hatched the Chao, you need to get it through the first
evolution.  The quickest way to do this is feed it coconuts from the Garden
until it forms a cocoon and evolves.  This will take very many coconuts, so
be patient.  This usually takes around fifteen or twenty minutes.

*NOTE* If the Chao you are raising was not "freshly hatched", you may be
able to skip the above step.  To test this, feed it a LifeNut.  If it
begins mating, it has already been through the first evolution.  Congrats.
If not, you need to do the above step, but it will not take as many
coconuts.


Next, you must have it reborn.  To do this:

1.  Have another Chao in a VMU play the matching game and win LifeNuts
(refer to the section titled Matching Game).  You will need anywhere from three
to eight LifeNuts for the entire process, and the VMU holds eight at a time.
When you receive LifeNuts for winning the game, do not eat them.  When you take
the Chao out of the VMU, the LifeNuts will come out with it.

2.  Feed the LifeNuts to your future Light Chao one-at-a-time.  Each time
flowers pop up around the Chao, it is ready to mate.  Bring another adult
Chao to it and they will mate, making an egg pop out of the ground.  Repeat
this process(three to five times) until the Chao begins its rebirth.

*NOTE* If the Chao falls asleep after eating a LifeNut, let it sleep.  It will 
wake up in about five minutes.

During the rebirth, a white cocoon forms around the Chao(the same one that 
forms when it evolves or dies).  When the cocoon goes away, it is an egg again.
Hatch this egg.

*NOTE*  When you hatch it, feed it something IMMEDIATELY!  Otherwise, it will
die.  The way I do it is I shake the egg, lay it down, grab a nearby coconut,
and hold the coconut against the egg.  When the egg hatches, the Chao inside
should immediately grab the nut and start eating.

NEXT STEP:  Have It Reborn Again

This works the same way: feed it coconuts until it evolves, give it a bunch
of LifeNuts, mate it, rehatch it.



NEXT STEP:  Give it ALL 15 Animals.

Now comes the fun part!  Give the Chao one of each animal.  Do this step
quickly and efficiently.  You can use any characters you like to get these
animals, but this is how I do it:

Knuckles:  Go to Sky Deck to get the skunk, swallow(bluebird), and the 
            peacock(green bird).
	   Go to Speed Highway to get the kangaroo, deer, and rabbit.
	   Return to the Garden to use these 6 animals.

	   Go to Red Mountain to get the mole, parrot, elephant, gorilla, and
            lion.
	   Go back to the garden to use these 5 animals.

Sonic:     Go to Emerald Coast to get the koala, sea otter, penguin, and seal.
	   Go back to the garden to use these 4 animals.

*NOTE* As you give the animals to the Chao, WRITE THEM DOWN!  Keep a list of
the animals you've given it!  I can't tell you how many Chao I have ruined
because I've skipped an animal or two.  Also, you don't want to give it more
than one of any animal.

There is a small checklist near the bottom of the guide which you can print out
and use.  This is invaluable!  Trust me.  The most common problem is not giving
it each animal.

Next Step:  Let It EVOLVE!

This takes about five or ten minutes.  While you wait, you might as well feed 
it some coconuts from the trees, as this apparently speeds up the process.  
Eventually, it should form that white cloud and evolve into a Light Chao.  
Notice that the white cloud has sparks shooting out of it.  Congratulations, 
you bred yourself a Light Chao!

--------------------------------------
3. What To Do With Your New Light Chao
--------------------------------------

So you made a Light Chao...now what?

Well, it's not like Chao are very useful in the first place, but Light Chao are
quite special and more useful than regular Chao.  Here is a list of things
which set them apart:

-They don't look right in the VMU!  Something messed up in the translation.  To
fix this:
   1. Delete the 128-page Chao Adventure file on the VMU.  Make sure there
      is not a Chao in the file when you delete it!
   2. Change the Text to Japanese from the Options menu.
   3. Navigate your way back to the Chao garden.  You can't read the words, so
      good luck.
   4. Put the Light Chao into the VMU.

-Light Chao NEVER DIE!  I've heard of Light Chao as old as 99 years.  I'm sure
if you abuse it, it will die, but if you are nice to it, age will not be a
problem.  This is great if you want to perfect it without it dying a few days
after it enters the garden.

-Animals don't change the Light Chao.  It will never grow bunny ears or hairy
arms.  I can't decide if this is a good or bad thing...

-Owning a Light Chao certainly raises your status, as Chao masters will respect
you and newbies will look up to you.


-----------------
4.  Matching Game
-----------------

The matching game is the game you play with the Chao in the VMU.  It's like 
Concentration for all you old-schoolers...so anyway, there's a 3X4 grid of six 
randomly-placed frits.  The grid is shown to you briefly, and then its covered 
up, and you try to match it.

If you make no mistakes, you get a special fruit(HastNut, StarNut, ChaoNut, and
LifeNut).  If you make less than three mistakes, you get a regular fruit.  Any
more mistakes and you lose.

The secret to the game is to memorize the pairs as quickly as you can.  Look 
for close-by pairs first.  Next, look for SYMMETRY.  For instance, maybe there 
is a 2X2 square where the diagonals are pairs.  When you get better, you'll 
notice pairs like this that are farther away, like the corners of the grid.

It's hard to explain, but you get the feel for it.  Practice makes perfect, I 
win the games perfectly 9 out of 10 times.

*NOTE*  You can use a video or digital camera up and cheat at the game, but
this is a waste.  You have to be pretty pathetic to cheat at Concentration.
You can also try writing down all the fruits with a system of symbols, but you
must be a fast writer.  It is much easier to simply remember the fruits IMHO.

---------------------------------------
5.  Advanced Strategy and Army Building
---------------------------------------

So, you want to build an army of Light Chao?  Want to brag to all your friends?
Want to take over the world and be a Chao GOD?  Well, good luck...I've compiled
some advice to do doing this...

First, you must have LOTS of free time.  No joke.  Most of you are still in
school, so I recommend waiting for a vacation or long weekend.

Next, you need more than one VMU.  Two is fine, but I used three.

Now, making Light Chao is a good opportunity to win prizes from the matching
game.  Pick or make a Chao, which you will use to play the matching game.
This Chao gets to eat all the extra fruit which isn't given to your future
Light Chao, and it mates with all your future Light Chao.

There are seven types of Light Chao:
Basic Light Chao(from regular egg)
Light Chao from Special Eggs: Black, Gold, Silver
Light Chao from Special Egg Hybrids: Black/Gold, Black/Silver, Gold/Silver

Note on Hybrids: These are formed by mating two different colored Chao in the
VMU.  One of the eggs will be a cross between the color of the two parents.
If it doesn't work, try it a few more times.  That's just how it woks.  It's
like DNA: mate a blue-eye with a brown-eye, and you won't always get a
green-eye.  I have not gotten a gold/silver hybrid, but it does exist in
theory, at least...

Start with the basic Light Chao.  If you can't get the first one, you
shouldn't try the rest of them.

Next, take the three special eggs and hatch them.  Make all three of them
evolve once.  Take them two-at-a-time and mate them in the VMU until you
have a baby of each hybrid type.

Next, start raising the single-colored Light Chao one-at-a-time.
After that, raise the hybrid Light Chao.

The gardens should be like this:

One garden for Light Chao-in-training, with only one Chao and occasionally
the Chao from the VMU which gets LifeNuts.  The eggs from mating can be
destroyed or sent somewhere else.

One garden for babies.  You should always save a baby of each color, in case
you make a mistake(what, you thought you could raise an army without messing
up even once?) or you want to do something else with them later.

One garden for Light Chao.

The garden for the Light Chao-in-training should not be the Egg Carrier
Garden, because animals will run into the ocean and never be seen again.
There is a superstition that Light Chao are raised faster in the Mystic
Ruins Garden, but it's just a superstition.  I use Station Square, since it is
the simplest of the three.

Now that you have all the Light Chao, what's next?

Well, you could raise all of their stats to 999, right?  Seven Perfect Chaos
Chao, right?  Well, to do that, you must have No Life.  You'll need to devote
probably a month of your entire life to this task.  It's not worth it.

--------------------
6. Nexus Memory Card
--------------------

There is a device out there known as the Nexus Memory Card.  This unique card
allows you to connect the memory card to a PC.  Through the PC, you can upload,
download, manage, and even HexEdit VMU files.

There are ways to edit the Chao Adventure file to change the Chao, such as
changing its stats, its features, its shape, and its fruits.  The biggest
feature is the ability to change the Chao type, so you can take a regular Chao
and change it into a Light Chao.  This is how Emerald Chao and even invisible
Chao are created.

I don't support this in any way, as I have always been against hacking and
cheating, but I have done it myself just for the sake of completeness.  It is
quite complicated, but there are three main websites you should go to if you
are interested:

http://www.levelsix.com/     -This site lets you buy the Nexus memory card and
                              PC cable for around $30.

http://www.booyaka.com/      -Register at this site(for free) and get access
                              to VMU save files, utilities, and message boards.

http://come.to/the-hidden-palace   -The greatest site by far.  If you enter the
                                    Hacking Project section, you can find the
                                    values for HexEditing.

Please do not E-Mail me concerning the Nexus memory card or hacking the files.
As I said, I do not support this in any way.  It is much like solving a puzzle,
so try to figure it out on your own.

* ADDITION * Alright, there is a very simple way to HexEdit yourself a Light
Chao.  First, get the 8-block Chao Download file(if you can't find/make it,
too bad).  Go into Edit mode and change the first value in the 0xC00 column to
06.  That's as simple as it gets, but if you can't understand it, don't ask me
about it.  There's plenty of info out there, so find it and figure it out
for yourself!


--------------------
7. Rumors Dispelled!
--------------------

RUMOR:  You need to give a Chao 15 animals in EACH of its lives for it to turn
        into a Light Chao.
FACT:  What a waste!  I'm sure it works, but it's completely unnecessary!

RUMOR:  You need to give a Chao a ChaoNut in its third life for it to turn into
        a Light Chao.
FACT:  It certainly couldn't hurt...I think it's more of a superstition.  I've
       made many Light Chao without them.

RUMOR:  Giving a Light Chao hundreds of animals in equal amounts will turn the
        Chao transparent.
FACT:  You'd have to be pretty thick-headed to try this one out...it is just
       someone's attempt to waste your time.  Yes, it could be possible, but
       you get nowhere by trying silly rumors like this.


RUMOR:  A group of VMU hackers have made Chao called A99 Chao, which are up to
        five times faster than 999 Chao.  Is this true?
FACT:  I believe this is true, but I have not seen one myself.  They will
       completely ruin the online Chao Races, so I'm sure Sonic Team will fix
       the problem.

RUMOR:  There is a secret code to raise your Chao's stats to 999.
FACT:  Of course not.  There was one rumor about making your Chao "spin" and
       get its stats raised at the rate of one per minute, but it was just a
       rumor.

RUMOR:  There are 3rd and 4th Generation Chao.
FACT:  I've heard that there is.  Just keep on giving it animals, and switch
       colors after awhile.  The number of possible Chao creations keeps on
       getting higher and higher.

RUMOR:  The Black Market is coming out on [various date].
FACT:  The Black Market is a place where you can use Emeralds found in the
       Adventure Mode to "buy" special Chao online.  We've been told that it is
       coming soon since around 9.9.99, and I doubt it will come soon.  Sonic
       Team is pretty busy, so don't whine about how long it's taking!

-------------------------
8.  Chao Races UNLEASHED!
-------------------------
That's right!  You can now compete in the Chao races on the Sonic Adventure web
page.  I think it was a bad idea from the beginning because once Chao have all
999 stats, they can't compete with each other.  To add to that, there's still
a problem with the competition...people are sending in 0:00.00 times for the 
races.  Sigh...

--------------------
9.  Troubleshooting:
--------------------
Did you start with a fresh, newborn Chao which was never given any animals?
Did you hatch the Chao three times(once at the beginning, twice through 
     rebirth)?
Did you give it each animal once, and only once?
Were you constantly nice to it(an occasional attack is okay)?

If you answered YES to all these questions, you may E-Mail me at 
slodeth@iname.com.  Try to tell me everything you did to your Chao.

--------------------
10. Links and Thanks
--------------------

http://fly.to/ChaoSpace/  -This site is great for starting out, but it lacks in
                           the more advanced parts.
http://www.gamefaqs.com/  -They've got info for tons of games, I turn to them 
                           first.
http://go.to/SloDethFAQs/ -My website.  Has the most current version of this
                           guide.


Thanx to all the people on the message board at ChaoSpace for helping me out.
Thanx to George!  I talked to him about Chao for a few weeks, and he helped me
develop my ideas.  Unfortunately, I have lost contact with him and his HTML
guide remains at v1.0.
Thanx to Nicole for the Chao ASCII graphic!

--------------------
11.  Version History
--------------------
1.6   06/28/00    Updated the guide to conform with my new FAQ format.  I added
new contact info, new links, and new HexEditing information

1.5   05/05/00    The planets are aligned today!  I decided to update this
before disaster strikes.  I changed some wording, added the Nexus Memory Card
section, and added the ASCII graphic(by Nicole).  It's good, isn't it?  I added
other things here and there.  I do believe this will be the final version, as
nothing new is happening in the Chao world and I don't have any more ideas.

1.2   03/03/00    A few cosmetic changes.  Added Rumors section and What To Do
With Your Light Chao section.

1.1   01/30/00    Changed the main strategy of the first evolution.  Added an
advanced strategy section.  Fixed a few things here and there.

1.0   01/25/00    I changed the strategy by adding some stat-building.  I added
a section on the matching game, and I thanked George.  He's the man!  I changed
the word "Chaos" to Chao because I found out that Chao is both singular and 
plural, like fish and deer.  I also changed the format so you don't need to use
WordWrap.  w00h00!

0.9   01/17/00    First Version.

-------------
12. Checklist
-------------
You can use this checklist to make sure you give your future Light Chao all the
animals.  This checklist is formatted so it will be easy to print and fit on
one page.  It is repeated thrice so you can save paper and reuse it.  You can
print it in one of two methods:
1.  Highlight the entire list.  Go to Print... in the File menu and Print the
    Selection.
2.  Highlight the entire list.  Hit Ctrl+C(copy) and open up Notepad.  Hit
    Ctrl+V(paste) and Print the entire document.

E-mail Rules:
Include the name of the game or guide in the subject.
E-mail me just about ANYTHING: questions(not answered in the guide), comments,
   praise, criticism, requests...
Ask me if you can use this guide.  I will almost certainly let you, as long as
   you ask politely.
Don't E-mail me crap.  Don't ask me to join a website, like AllAdvantage.
Don't spend any less than one minute writing your E-mail.  Check it over and
   make sure you used correct spelling, decent grammar, and capitalization.
AOL slang is not up to my standards.  Don't use "r u" instead of "are you" or
   anything like that.

ICQ Rules:
Do whatever you wish.  I don't care about ICQ very much.  Put my number on spam
   lists, tell it to your friends, and flood it with whatever you want.

What you can find at my web page:
-More info on me(in case you care)!
-Links to all of my guides!
-The most recent versions of my guides!
-HTML versions of my guides!
-Feedback forms, surveys, and some other crap!
-News on what I've done and what I plan on doing!

Please do not distribute this guide in any way without my explicit permission.
I'm sure you could use it and mutilate it to your pleasing, but I'd appreciate
it if you write to me first.  I'm very willing to give out this guide, given
that it is not changed in any way.
