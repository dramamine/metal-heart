Serious Sam is one of those rare games when a group of amateurs decide to
program a game and get recognized by a company.  Developed by a group of
people who are living in a warring country (sorry to the developers, but
the name of your country escapes me at the moment.  I am assuming Croatia,
due to the name of your company.  If not, sorry.).  They banded together
to create a game which was originally going to be downloadable over the
Internet.  Over time, the Serious Sam tech demo was witnessed by a bunch of
people and gathered massive hype.  Why?  The game looks gorgeous and
gameplay compliments the graphics just as well.

Eventually, a member of Gathering of Developers, the people responsible for
the ill-fated "Blair Witch" line of games, noticed this so-called "tech
demo" and decided that these amateurs had real potential.  Talks eventually
led to the developers of the game, Croteam, to sign a publishing deal with
GOD.

Now, in March 2001, the game has hit stores, and is an amazing product
which has definitely lived up to its hype.  May I congratulate Croteam for
creating an amazing game and to Gathering of Developers for signing a group
of soon-to-be famous developers.

| [3] Serious Sam Review                                                      |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Serious Sam is one of the best first-person-shooter I have played in a long
time.  If you are looking to purchase Serious Sam for an engrossing
storyline, intricate character development and puzzles galore, then turn
away and buy Half-Life.  If you were an avid Doom player looking for the
smallest amount of puzzles and an insane amount of killing, then buy this
game.  While Serious Sam does feature some puzzles and attempts a story, the
best aspect of the game is the constant killing and there's lots of it.
Some missions throw around 800 enemies at you in total.  Sometimes the game
will send out 40 enemies at once to attack you, give you an ammo pack when
they're all dead, then throw another 40 at you.  This is what Serious Sam is
all about.

The graphics engine is simply amazing.  The game was supposed to originally
be a tech demo to showcase the engine that these guys built, and when turned
into a full-fledged game, it shows.  There are great effects, and the lens
flare is some of the best I have ever seen.  The game engine is capable of
very large outdoor levels, and interiors are just as well done.  Capable of
throwing a near-limitless amount of enemies on-screen at once, you can
understand why the hefty system requirements.

Gameplay: The gameplay is just like Doom, set in an Egyptian setting.  You
          run around, find Ankh's and other similar items, and solve easy
          puzzles to open doors.  All the while battling 30-50 enemies.
          There are times when your thrown into a "gauntlet" area, where all
          doors shut, sealing you in, only opening after 100 enemies, in
          different waves have been defeated.

          As much as I love killing critters non-stop, there are times when
          it becomes too much without replenishing your ammo supply.  I
          found myself throwing my keyboard on the desk and saying 'Goddamn
          enough is enough!'

Sound:    Sound effects and music are well done.  There's nothing like
          hearing the agonizing screams of Kamikazi men as they come running
          at you with bombs on both hands.  Believe me, you will hear them
          long before you're able to see them.

          The music is just as good.  When fighting bosses or certain large
          amounts of enemies, a heavy metal song will kick in, perfectly
          complimenting the barrage of fire you're most likely exchanging.

Multiplayer:  Nothing special here.  There's the standard Deathmatch, as
              well as a welcome Cooperative, but a team game, like Capture
              The Ankh or something, as well as a built-in server finder,
              would have been gladly welcomed by everyone.  Cooperative is
              extremely fun, and a workmate and I made it to level five
              before he tossed two rockets my way and killed me.  If anybody
              is interested in a game, please send me an e-mail.

Overall:  When everything is said and done, Serious Sam is an enjoyable kill
          fest, which will numb your finger instead of your mind.  If this
          were a professional review, I'd rate it 9.5 out of 10.

Recommendation:  BUY THIS GAME!


*SloDeth's additions: I have to put emphasis on the 'Goddamn, enough is
enough!' aspect.  As much as I love killing, it's a bit too much at times.
The game is cheap enough, though...if it was more expensive, I don't know
if it would be worth it, but at $20, it's worth every penny.*

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

At the dawn of the 21st Century, mankind makes a startling discovery.
Beneath the sands of the earliest known human civilization, traces of
another, even more ancient-but technologically advanced-civilization are
uncovered.  The profound scientific implications of this discovery leads
humankind to the far reaches of the universe.  Everything seems perfect,
but too perfect to last.

In the year 2104, human civilization is attacked by countless deadly
monsters spawned from another dimension.  In the battles that follow,
humankind fights valiantly, but nothing can stop the monsters from coming.
Earth's forces are steadily defeated, planet-by-planet, from Alpha
Centaury back to their own solar system.

Because of his extreme bravery in battling monsters, Sam 'Serious' Stone
becomes a legend.  Wounded countless times-but never defeated-Serious Sam
becomes a living symbol of the Earth's resistance against the advancing
evil.

But, no matter how bravely human armies fight, they are defeated, time and
again.  Attempts to defend the solar system fail and the Earth is now under
direct attack.  Humankind stares into the face of it's own annihilation.

World leaders must now turn to their last chance-an ancient artifact called
the 'Time-Lock', a relic from a long-forgotten race, imbued with the power
to teleport a single person back in time.  The choice of whom to send is
obvious.

Serious Sam becomes the final hope for humankind.  He must return to the
past and change it to save his race from extinction from an evil force
determined to purge the galaxy of all intelligent life.

| [7] Single Player Difficulty Level Differences                              |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Tourist Mode:  For people who have never played a FPS or people who only
               play FPS's occasionally.  Enemies are slow, dumber, easier
               to kill and do less damage.  There are not many spawns.

Easy Mode:     For people who enjoy first-person-shooters and are just
               getting into them.  Enemies are fairly slow, not too bright,
               fairly easy to kill and do fairly low damage.  There are a
               few spawns.

Normal Mode:   For people who enjoy first-person-shooters and have been
               playing them for a while.  Enemies have moderate speed, are
               fairly smart, they have moderate strength and do moderate
               amounts of damage.  There are a good number of spawns.

Hard Mode:     For people who have been playing first-person-shooters for
               a long time and enjoy a challenge.  Enemies are fast, they
               are smart, they are tough to kill and they do a good deal of
               damage.  There are a lot of spawns.

Serious Mode:  For people who's only place in this world is to play first-
               person-shooters.  Enemies are faster then you, they are
               extremely intelligent, they are a pain-in-the-ass to kill
               and they do tremendous amounts of damage.  There are near-
               constant spawns.

| [8] NETRICSA (NEuroTRonically Implanted Combat Simulation Analyzer)         |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

NETRICSA is a small computer implanted inside Sam's skull.  Sam's NETRICSA
is the best available of the wide range of such devices, common among head-
to-head fighters.  It is a neurotronical computer connected to the
perceptual cortexes in his brain.  The computer has all the access to his
audio-visual experiences and can provide him with feedback.  It is used to
provide fast and simple access to all the necessary data and analysis for a
skilled combatant, so that he/she can keep up to date with the situation
and know what to do next.  It translates texts, offers simple head-up-
display directly to the visual cortex, tracks targets and gives other kinds
of help in fight and in general tactics.

In game, NETRICSA appears on your screen in two different ways; as a heads-
up-display and as a full screen computer interface.

Heads-Up-Display is active normally while you explore the area or fight.
In the lower left corner, it shows your current ARMOR and HEALTH state.
Next to it, your CURRENT WEAPON and currently carried amount of AMMUNITION
for it is displayed.  On the far right is an icon for each type of ammo you
have and a small bar showing how much of that type do you have.

In the upper left corner is SCORE, showing the sum of reward money you have
collected by eliminating your enemies and completing other tasks.  When a
NETRICSA has a new message for you, you will hear a notification sound and
MESSAGE COUNTER (upper right corner) with number of pending messages will
appear below the account display.  Then you can invoke NETRICSA full screen
to examine the message.

On the center of the screen is NETRICSA's target detection display.  A
CROSSHAIR shows exactly where your weapon will hit, and it changes colors
according to the state of your target.  While you have no live target, it
is WHITE.  When you aim at a new enemy, it will become GREEN, and as you
damage the enemy, the color will turn RED.

If you target an item that can be used or operated (e.g. a switch), a USE
indicator will appear above the crosshair.  Press USE BUTTON to operate the
item.  If you target an item that can be analyzed, an ALAKYZE indicator
will appear.  Press USE BUTTON to analyze the item.  After analyzing it, a
new message will appear with description of the results of NETRICSA's
research.

To read any of the NETRICSA's messages, you can invoke NETRICSA fullscreen
at any time by double clicking the USE BUTTON.

In fullscreen mode, NETRICSA shows four windows:

CATEGORY SELECTION in the upper left has five buttons allowing you to
select one of the message categories: Tactical Data, Strategic Data,
Weapons, Enemies, and Statistics.

MESSAGE LIST in the upper right shows list of messages in currently
selected category.

MESSAGE TEXT in the lower right shows the message text, while MESSAGE IMAGE
at the lower left shows eventual visual information attached to the
message.  You can scroll both the message list and the message text with
their accompanied sliders.

You can exit the fullscreen NETRICSA by either clicking on the EXIT button
in the upper right corner, or by pressing ESCAPE or he RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Multiplayer Information:

- TCP/IP play supported both in LAN and on the Internet
- Split-Screen for multiplayer on one computer, even without network
- Supports GameSpy, for easier location of servers and co-players on the
  Internet
- Up to 16 players in one game
- Up to 4 players on one computer (Split-Screen)

| [11.1] Cooperative                                                          |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

In standard Cooperative mode, players play together against enemies.
Optionally, you can allow/disallow players to accidentally harm each other
(friendly fire).

You can play custom levels of your choice, or play an entire game together,
from beginning to the end.

Optionally, you can allow items (health, weapons, ammo) to be picked up by
all players, so they don't have to split them.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [11.2] Deathmatch/Scorematch                                                |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Deathmatch on score.  For each item you pick up your own value is raised by
the value of that item (shown when picked up).   Also, your value slowly
increases with time, faster if you are standing still than if you are
moving.  When you kill someone, his value is added to your score, and half
of his value is added to your value.

In short, the longer you live, the more items you pick up, and more you
kill, the more valuable you will be for the one who kills you.  So, it is
not worth killing people who just respawned.  Let them live longer and
build their value up.

Also, if you kill yourself, your vale is subtracted from your own score.

A Scorematch game can be set on a time limit or score limit base.  Person
with highest score at the end wins.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [11.3] Deathmatch/Fragmatch                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

This is standard Deathmatch mode.  For every kill, you get one frag more;
if you kill yourself, you lose one frag.  A Fragmatch game can be set on a
time limit or frag limit base.  Person with most frags at the end wins.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Legend:

M = Metabolism
P = Perception
S = Size
E = Endurance
H = Hostility
W = Weapon
R = Reward
T = Threat

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [12.1] Beheaded Rocketeer                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

M = cyber-zombie
P = insentient, LCU controlled
S = 6 ft.
E = very low
H = very low
W = magic-missile launcher
R = 200 FC
T = none

Use anything to defeat this guy.  Switch to the Shofields if you're running low
on other ammo, or use the most convenient weapon at the time.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [12.2] Gnarr, Female                                                        |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

M = mammal
P = trained war animal
S = 5 ft.
E = low
H = low
W = bites, punches
R = 1000 FC
T = low

Some of these can either levitate or become invisible in the later levels, so
be careful.  I usually use a Double Barrel to take these out.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [12.3] Beheaded Bomber                                                      |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

M = cyber-zombie
P = insentient, LCU controlled
S = 6 ft.
E = very low
H = very low
W = hand grenades
R = 500 FC
T = low

Treat this guy just like the Rocketeer, only back up after you kill it to avoid
the explosion.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [12.4] Gnarr, Male                                                          |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

M = mammal
P = trained war animal
S = 4 ft.
E = low
H = low
W = bites, punches
R = 500 FC
T = very low

Again, use the Double Barrel to take this guy out.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [12.5] Beheaded Firecracker                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

M = cyber-zombie
P = insentient, LCU controlled
S = 6 ft.
E = very low
H = very low
W = magic-missile launcher
R = 200 FC
T = none

This is the first projectile-launching enemy.  Kill these quickly after
entering a large room to make your job easier.  If you see a pack of these,
break out your Minigun and mow them down.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [12.6] Kleer Skeleton                                                       |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

M = undead
P = magical creature
S = 9 ft.
E = low
H = medium
W = two-ball projectiles, claws, horns
R = 1000 FC
T = medium

These can be quite dangerous in packs.  They shoot projectiles from a distance,
and they jump towards you to deliver a big slash.  If they come one-at-a-time,
wait for one to jump, then blast it with your Double Barrel.  Use your Rocket
Launcher or the Minigun to take out a mass of Skeletons at a distance.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [12.7] Beheaded Kamikaze                                                    |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

M = cyber-zombie
P = insentient, LCU controlled
S = 6 ft.
E = very low
H = extreme
W = hand grenade
R = 2500 FC
T = high

These are the most annoying enemies in the game.  They run at you and explode
on impact.  They scream constantly, and you can judge their distance by their
sound.  When you enter a room with Kamikazes, take them out first with your
Submachine Gun, or your Shofields if the threat is low.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [12.8] Marsh Hopper from Rigil Kentaurus                                    |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

M = terrestrial amphibian
P = wild animal
S = 3 ft.
E = none
H = extreme
W = toxic slime splash
R = 500 FC
T = very low

You don't see many of these in the game.  Use your Minigun or Submachine Gun to
take out packs of these.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [12.9] Sirian Warbull                                                       |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

M = mammal
P = labor animal
S = 9 ft.
E = low
H = medium
W = horns
R = 2000 FC
T = medium

These can be very tough, even alone.  It takes two shots with your Double
Barrel, so try shooting it once when it gets close, then quickly sidestepping
out of the way.  Use Rockets or the Lasergun if you see them at a distance.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [12.10] Bio-Mechanoid, Minor                                                |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

M = endothermous cyborg
P = genetically programmed
S = 15 ft. standing
E = medium
H = high
W = pulse lasers
R = 2000 FC
T = medium

These are quick, but simple.  Take them out with a single Rocket.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [12.11] Arachnoid, Juvenile                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

M = ectothermous, anthropod
P = primitive sentient race
S = 10 ft.
E = medium
H = extreme
W = chain-gun, tail sting
R = 1000 FC
T = high

These are quite dangerous and annoying.  They fire at you constantly with their
chainguns.  Hide behind any obstacle you can, then step out and fire some
projectile at one.  Whatever you do, don't stand still and get filled with
bullets!

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [12.12] Arachnoid, Adult                                                    |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

M = ectothermous, anthropod
P = primitive sentient race
S = 20-25 ft.
E = high
H = extreme
W = chain-gun, tail sting
R = 5000 FC
T = high

These are like the enemy above, only stronger.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [12.13] Bio-Mechanoid, Major                                                |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

M = endothermous cyborg
P = genetically programmed
S = 30 ft. standing
E = high
H = high
W = rocket launchers
R = 7500 FC
T = high

These are much bigger and stronger than their minor counterparts.  It will take
five Rockets to take them out.  They fire rockets that can be shot down, so try
using a Lasergun or a Minigun if Rockets aren't working for you.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [12.14] Aludron Reptiloid, Common                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

M = cold-blooded, reptile-like
P = primitive race
S = 15 ft.
E = medium
H = high
W = magic homing missiles
R = 5000 FC
T = medium

Use a Lasergun or a Minigun to kill these.  If you use a Rocket Launcher, it
might hit one of its fireballs, wasting your ammo.  Wasting a bullet is much
better than wasting a rocket, right?

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [12.15] Aludron Reptiloid, Highlander                                       |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

M = cold-blooded, reptile-like
P = primitive race
S = 45 ft.
E = high
H = high
W = magic homing missiles
R = 25000 FC
T = high

This is the boss from the Valleys.  Since you acquire your Rocket Launcher at
the same point in the level, use it against him.  14 Rockets will take him out.
His homing missiles are red instead of green.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [12.16] Reeban Electro-Fish                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

M = aquatic vertebrate
P = wild animal
S = 11 ft. in length
E = low
H = high
W = electric discharges
R = 500 FC
T = medium

These fish swim and zap you if you get close.  Use a shotgun to take them out.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [12.17] Scythian Witch-Harpy                                                |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

M = mammal
P = trained clone
S = 5 ft. standing
E = low
H = medium
W = magic projectiles, claws
R = 1000 FC
T = low

These can be quite difficult in packs.  Try running around in a circle until
they get in close proximity of each other, then fire a rocket or three into the
middle of the pack.  Most of them will lose their wings and scatter.  Use a
shotgun to take them out individually.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [12.18] Lava Golem                                                          |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

M = inorganic
P = magical creature
S = 10 to 100 ft.
E = medium to extreme
H = high
W = fireballs
R = 500-50000 FC
T = low to extreme

Use your strongest weapons to take out the big ones.  When they die,
mini-golems will pop up to further pursue you.  Use a rocket launcher a shotgun
to take them out.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [12.19] Ugh-Zan III, The Vicious Warlock                                    |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

M = immortal mammal
P = ancient entity
S = 330 ft.
E = infinite
H = extreme
W = homing missiles
    thermal bombs
    rocket launcher
    pulse lasers
    beamgun
R = 1 million FC
T = immeasurable

Use your Cannon until it runs dry, then use anything else until you can find
more cannonballs.  KEEP RUNNING!

===============================================================================

| [13] Items                                                                  |

| [15] Walkthrough Introduction                                               |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

This walkthrough was done on the Normal difficulty setting.

I have tried to explore each level very thoroughly, so that I could give
you access to the weapons and items otherwise ignored by players seeking to
just complete the game.  If I missed a secret or out-of-the-way item, an
e-mail informing me would be appreciated.  You will be credited for any
help you give me.

If you are looking to collect all the secrets, check out DPlote's Secrets FAQ
over at GameFAQs.com.  Use it as an addendum to this guide if you must, because
I'm not very thorough when it comes to the secrets in this game.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [15.1] Hatshepsut Temple - Level 1                                          |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

As soon as you have control, head up the ramp to the tunnel.  You will be
attacked by a Beheaded Rocketeer.  Kill him and proceed up.  You will see
more Rocketeers coming from the right side, but don't worry about them;
they will be killed by a bolt of lightning.  At the top of the ramp, there
is a +10 Health vial you may need.  Turn right, and cross the platform you
see.

Turn left when in the temple and run all the way around to collect two
boxes of Shotgun shells.  Turn around and run to the middle, where you will
see a hallway.  Run straight down the hallway to the other side and turn
left.  Follow until you get another box of Shotgun shells.  Return to the
hallway.  Continue down the hallway until you come to a fork.  Collect the
extra Shofield (double the firepower) and continue down the hall towards
the door.  Just as you get to it, a new creature will spawn; the Female
Gnarr.  Back up while shooting to kill it.  When it's dead, enter the door.

You are now in a room with a big pool.  To your left and right are pieces
of armor, totalling 14.  A new enemy will be introduced; the Beheaded
Bomber.  In the far right corner there is a +25 Health bottle if you need
it, and in the center of the poll is a +50 Health box.  Enter the door
opposite the one you came in.

In the right hand side of this room is +50 Armor and a box of Shotgun
Shells.  In the left hand side of the room you will find a new weapon; the
12 Gauge Pump Action Shotgun.  Upon picking up the shotgun, you will be
attacked by five or six Rocketeers, as well as two Gnarr's, one male and
one female, and two new monsters; Beheaded Firecracker and Kleer Skeleton.

When all creatures have been dispatched, enter the door.  Mission over!

| [15.2] Sand Canyon - Level 2                                                |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

As soon as you gain control, walk out the door and collect five boxes of
shells.  Head down toward the health bottle and climb the hill.  As you
reach the crest of the hill, a new enemy will run at you; the Beheaded
Kamikaze.  After taking care of him, 15-20 more will come at you in rapid
succession.  Try to kill them when they are grouped so the resulting
explosion will take out or seriously damage the others.  Continue up the
hill.

On the other side of the hill are a mix of enemies.  Dispatch them all with
extreme serious-ness, then grab the shells to the left of the tomb, the
armor directly across from the tomb entrance and the armor shard in the
middle.  Enter the tomb.

Grab the armor and head down.  Ignore the door directly in front of you for
now and turn left.  There's a box of shells and a Health Vial.  As soon as
you pick up either object, two Kleer Skeleton's will race down the ramp
towards you.  Kill them, head up the ramp, and proceed through the door you
earlier ignored.

Head down to the gate and you will see a group of baddies run by.  Walk
forward until the gate opens, then head to the left, the opposite way the
creatures were running.  Be prepared to back up as you enter the room
because a giant rock-ball with fall and roll at you.  Once it has passed,
go back in the room and collect the shells, armor and health (if needed).
Turn around and go the way the monsters went.  When you enter the room,
there will be a welcome party for you of different monsters.  When you have
killed them all, panels in the wall will open up and realize about 20-30
annoying little bastards called Marsh Hoppers.  Kill these things as fast
as you can.  If you look to the right of the door you entered, you will see
an off-colored wall pane.  Touch it to reveal a Tommygun and ammunition.
Enter the door at the other end of the room.

In this room is yet another group for you to exterminate.  Once their out
of the picture, search the room for shells, armor, armor shards and a
health bottle.  When you've collected everything, head to the dark hallway
and proceed down the ramp.  A Gnarr and those annoying Marsh Hoppers will
spawn in front of you.  Switch to the Tommygun and shoot all of them in a
circular motion, from left to right.  When they are dead, continue your
journey.  In the room ahead, collect the armor and health bottle (if
needed) and proceed through the door.

Collect the shells here if needed and proceed through the canyon, killing
everything and anything who dare stop you, Mr. Sam Stone.  At the first
fork, take a right to get shells and a health vial (if needed).  At the
next fork, take a right to get more shells and armor, and a left for a
health vial (if you go for the health, be wary of the the rock-ball that
will drop down in a pathetic attempt to crush you.  Keep going through the
canyon, taking the forks to collect items.  When you get closer to the
tomb, a bunch of creatures will emerge, including a huge robot.  Five or
six shotgun blasts will short-circuit him.  To reach the items that appear
inaccesible on the roof of the tomb, climb up the mountain on the side by
constantly jumping.  When you've collected the items, five Gnarr's will
spawn behind you.  Kill them, then jump back down and proceed into the
tomb.

As you enter the tomb, a cutscene will take over in which Sam finds the
first Element, and the mission is over.  Congratulations!

| [15.3] Tomb Of Ramses - Level 3                                             |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Once the level loads, there will be two enemies right in front of you, to
your left and right, standing by the pillars.  You have a few seconds
before they turn to fire on you, so use those seconds to kill them.  When
they're dead, pick up the four boxes of shells in this room.  Upon picking
up the first box, a Gnarr will spawn, so be ready for it.  When you've got
everything from this room, proceed to the hallway and up the ramp.

A Kamikazi will spawn before you reach the top, so be ready to wipe him
out.  Turn right and head up the small set of stairs, killing the bomber
while climbing.  Continue into the large room.  To your left is a door
which leads into a room containing a Health Vial and four boxes of shells.
Grab them if they're needed, then exit the room and head to the door
directly across from you.  There is a box of shells and a Health Shard in
this room.  Climb up the stairs in the right corner to grab a Health Vial,
then take a running jump over to the raised platform.  You are in a secret
place, and the room ahead contains shells and +50 Armor.  Grab them both,
then return to the main room and head up the stairs in the central area.
There is a Health Vial if needed, as well as a Rocketeer.  When you get
closer to the hallway, a Kleer Skeleton will attack you.  Kill it and
continue.

Look in between the last two pillars on the left side for a box of shells.
Move forward into the room ahead and be prepared to fight a Bomber and some
Gnarr's.  There are also two Health Shards and two Armor Shards in this
room.  Move deeper and check between the pillars for a Health Vial and more
shells.  See that big red heart above?  We'll get to that in a minute.  As
you walk through the pillars, some Rocketeer's will jump down.  Kill them
and move into the room.  Some more Rocketeer's will spawn, as well as a
Kleer Skeleton.  When they are no longer living, move forward, and you'll
be attacked by a Gnarr.  Kill him and go to where he came from for a box of
shells and a Health Vial.  Head back into the main room and head to the
stairs.  As you get closer, two Gnarr's and possibly a Rocketeer will jump
down from the ramp.  Kill them and then climb the stairs.  Grab the armor,
then jump on top of the fire basket.  From the fire, jump up to the ledge
and head right.  Follow this around the room, and it will lead you to the
big heart, giving you +100 Health, which will take your max health over
100.  Turn around and return to where you jumped up, but don't jump back
down; go straight into the small room and grab the shells, then walk
forward into a room lined with pillars.  You're in a secret passage.

As you approach the door at the end, it slams shut, and a Gnarr and
Juvenile Arachnoid will spawn. Kill them and head toward the now-reopened
door.  There are stairs on both sides of this room, but for the sake of the
walkthrough, take the right set.  Kill the Rocketeer, proceed into the
room, and kill another Arachnoid.  Jump on the platform for more shells.
Head to the stairs in the far left corner.  See that weapon up there?  You
want it, right?  Walk along the ledge and you will see a piece of it
missing, making you fall if you stepped on it.  Nope.  Walk onto that
missing piece, and it will teleport you to the ledge, where you can pick up
the Rocket Launcher.  Jump back down, collect the Armor and Health Vial,
then head deeper into the tomb.

In the next room, there is a box of shells and more armor.  Test out your
new Rocket Launcher on the Arachnoid that spawns further down the room.
Two shots will kill it if playing on Normal difficulty.  Head into the room
where the Arachnoid was.  You'll encounter around five to seven Rocketeer's
as well as a Gnarr or two.  Kill them all and head to the corners of the
room for a Health Shard and box of shells.  A Kleer Skeleton is standing
near the shells, so take him out first.  When everything has been picked
up, head up the stairs.

When you come to a fork that lets you go left or climb stairs to the right,
take the stairs.  There is a Health Vial and box of shells here.  As soon
as you grab the Vial, an Arachnoid will spawn.  If you don't need the vial
or shells, then you can avoid this fight, but I recommend you fight anyway,
so you get better points.  When you've got both items and/or killed the
Arachnoid, head the way you ignored just a few seconds ago.  Climb another
set of stairs, and there will be a Health Bottle.  We'll get to that big
heart hidden in the nook above you soon.  Continue around and climb two
more stairs.  On this next platform are two Health Vials.  Grab them if
needed, then continue around.  There is a Gnarr on this platform somewhere.
Climb up the stairs and enter the room on your right.  There is a Bomber,
Kleer Skeleton and a Rocketeer in this room, as well as an Armor Shard.
When they've been dealt with, head up the stairs in the right corner of the
room for shells and a Health Vial.  Head back down the stairs, then
continue out the door and around the platform until you see a door.  Don't
enter the door just yet; we're gonna grab that Heart.  Facing the door, do
a 360 turn so you're looking at the wall.  Run across the small
bridge-type thing, and begin heading to the pillar in the middle.  If you
look down, you'll notice two platforms extending to the left and right.
Take the right one, and follow it to the Heart.  Grab it, then return to
and enter the door.

Oh my God.  More stairs.  These things are starting to piss me off more
then the monsters.  Climb them, then about halfway up, two Rocketeer's will
jump down behind you.  Kill them and continue up, only to find two more
Rocketeer's, a Firecracker and a Kamikazi.  Kill them all.  Kill them good.
Head forward and climb another set of stairs.  You may notice off to your
far right a Firecracker.  If you can see him, target him with your duel
Shofield's and kill him.  Continue climbing the stairs.  When you get to
the top, grab the Armor Shard.  A Rocketeer will spawn to your right, and
an Arachnoid will spawn up and behind you.  Obviously, kill the Arachnoid
first.  We'll grab the armor beside the Arach later.  At the top of the
stairs, run along each ledge and grab the Health Bottle and shells.
Continue into the room, grab the Armor Shard from the right, and head up
the small stairs in the center.  Head to the blue armor, and three
Beheaded's will spawn, as well as a Kleer.  Grab the armor, turn around,
and head up the spiral-like staircase to grab an armor shard.  A Bomber and
Gnarr will spawn when you do.  Kill them, head back down the stairs, and go
to the other set of stairs behind and to the right of the armor.  There is
a Health Box if needed. To the right of the health, you will see a somewhat
dark area.  Go to it and follow the now-revealed hall.  You're in a secret
room with bullets, rockets, and a Health Bottle.  To the far right of the
hallway is a doorway.  Enter it and follow the ledge around and you'll be
able to grab that armor we earlier saw.  Head back to the room with the
ammo and go down the hallway.  Behind the health box are six boxes of
shells and a doorway with statues on both sides.  Go through it.

You are now in a big room with a Double Barrel Coach Gun in the center.
Either make a run for it, or kill everything first.  You will have to
contend with Rocketeer's, Kleer Skeletons, Kamikazi's, Bomber's, Gnarr's,
Marsh Hopper's, and a new enemy, the Arachnoid Adult.  This thing takes
four direct rocket hits to kill.  Don't worry if you wasted a lot of shells
in this battle; there are four boxes by the Coach Gun, and a couple more,
as well as Health Bottles, are spread throughout the room.  There is also
one Armor piece.  When everything is dead, a piece of the wall will slide
down, revealing more stairs.  Go up the center stairs, then up the right
set, collect the +50 Health (you most likely need it) then enter the door
and climb the ramp.  A cutscene will take over when you reach the top,
showing Sam collecting the second Element.  Good work on yet another
successful mission!

| [15.4] Valley Of The Kings - Level 4                                        |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

* NOTE * IF YOU WANT TO GO TO THE SECRET LEVEL, MOON MOUNTAINS, YOU MUST
DESTROY ALL THE STATUES IN THIS LEVEL.  KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN FOR THEM!

When you begin, climb either set of stairs.  You will find ten, yes count
'em, ten boxes of shells just waiting to be picked up.  Take as many as you
can, then save your game; the first part of this level is nothing but wave
after wave after wave of monsters who are pissed at you for coming this
far.

I am not going to provide a walkthrough for the first part, simply because
of what I said above; nothing but monsters.  All you have to do is kill
them all so that the door at the other end opens.  When everything appears
to be dead, move forward to unleash more.  Near a tree, around the middle,
there is a Health Bottle and four boxes of shells.  There are also more
Health and shells spread out about the level, but they're easily seen so I
won't go into details of their location.

Here is a list of all the monsters you will face here:

Rocketeer
Gnarr, both Male and Female
Bomber
Kleer Skeleton
Kamikazi
Sirian Warbull
Bio-Mechanoid, Minor (blue)
Bio-Mechanoid, Major (red - new creature; you haven't fought him yet.  He
                      shoots two rockets at a time)
Marsh Hopper

As you get closer to the tomb, a new enemy, the Aludran Reptiloid Common,
will spawn.  He fires homing green missiles, which are huge balls.  They
can be shot down with any weapon.

After all the enemies are defeated, head toward the tomb.  There is a +50
Health Box, as well as another Rocket Launcher and packs of rockets.  After
picking up the weapon, a big green bar will appear at the top center of
your screen.  Could this be a life meter?  Yes, it is, for the boss you now
hve to fight.  He appears right behind you, close to where you started the
level from.  He's a yellow gargantuan, and fires homing fireballs at you.
Strafe to the left and right to avoid the balls while keeping him targeted.
It will take 14 rockets to kill him.  When he's dead, check NETRICSA and
you'll see he was the daddy of the green one you killed.  Continue into the
tomb door and a cutscene will show a Gold Ankh you need to retrieve.

Walk down the ramp and kill everything.  There is a Health Vial in front of
the pillar the Ankh is on.  Grab it if needed, and head down the left ramp
into the room.

To start off, you need to press the two buttons in the side rooms.  Each one
summons a few enemies, including grunts, Arachnoids, Gnaars, and a Reptilioid.
Once you clear out the area, grab the Gold Ankh, then go through the next door.
Grab the armor and go down the ramp, then continue following the path through a
narrow doorway.  Once you kill two Gnaars, the next door opens.  Go through,
and destroy the STATUE if you feel like it.  Go down the ramp.  You'll see a
STATUE to the left, then take the right path.  If you go forward in the room
and up the ramp, you'll find a STATUE and a piece of papyrus.  Go back to the
room and down the ramp.  You find frogs and an Arachnoid.  When you round the
corner(through the darkness) and press the button, a bunch of Skeletons charge
at you.  Retrace your steps and take a right into a big room.  Grab the heart
in the center.  It's an ambush!  Grunts surround you immediately, then
Skeletons march around you.  Shoot some through the bars with your double
Shotgun, then when they open, continue onward.

Go in the room in the left.  Press the button at the foot of the STATUE, then
go across the hallway.  Dive into the pond and grab the Stone Ankh at the
bottom.  Leave the room and go to the right.  Take the Tommygun in the center.
Frogs spawn from that light in the center.  Stand in a good position, then
shoot each one as it appears.  It won't be difficult if you can take out each
one before it becomes a threat.  Go up the ramp in the corner and continue
onward.  At the top, you find a room with four STATUES.  Go into the next room.
If you took out all of the statues, a pendulum should have activated.  Go to
the right on the cliff.  If you see a pendulum platform swinging across, jump
on it, then jump to the cliff on the other side to enter the secret level.  If
not, just jump in the river.

The first area is a series of large, green platforms.  Enemies and items spawn
on each one.  When you get to the last one, jump off to another one.  Follow
its path through some caves - you encounter some Gnarrs and grunts, but it's no
big deal.  When you find the next open area, look around and admire the view.
Break out your Rocket Launcher.  Fire a few at the enemies directly forward and
down, then use it to kill the Harpies.  Go to the other side and hop down, then
enter the next cave.  Go in the hole.  You fall in a lake filled with those
electro-fishes.  Surface, then go through the door.  On the other side of the
cave, grab the rockets and bullets.  When you go forward some more, a huge
Bio-Mechanoid appears...just like the one you battled in the last level!  Use
your Rocket Launcher and finish him off quickly.  When you go into the next
room, the level ends...

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

*note: the following walkthroughs are written entirely by SloDeth*

Welcome to the Oasis.  Surface, and run around grabbing items to replenish
yourself.  Soon, enemies will start appearing near the building.  Use your
rockets to take them out.  When you hear enemies generating behind you,
including some Kamikazes, break out your Tommy Gun.  Mow down the Kamikazes,
then the Skeletons.  After the rush is over, grab any last items, then enter
the building.

Inside, grab the items to the immediate sides first, then enter and take the
grenade launcher.  I know you're eager to try out the new weapon, so enter the
door on the left and fire a few grenades.  Switch back to the double shotgun,
back up to the main room and take out any other Skeletons.  Enter the left
room, take the grenades, and blast the monsters.  Go in the right room now -
use your rocket launcher to take out the Arachnoid immediately.  If you follow
the path around, you find a backpack in the middle of a large room.  Take it,
then step back and switch to the Tommygun.  Frogs will generate like crazy in
this room until you kill a few hundred of them.  Run around the room in
circles, using your Tommygun constantly.  If they form a nice pack, fire ONE
rocket into the pack, then switch back to the Tommygun.  When you finish, enter
the next room.

In here, there are five layers of enemies which generate from the back to the
front in increasing difficulty.  Step forward and take out the one in the back,
then repeat.  The last layer is another series of frogs - use your Tommygun
again.  Continue on to find another element.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

In this desert area, kill the enemies around the area.  Some Mechanoids attack,
as well as some Bulls, then some Gnaars, then a large Mechanoid.  Cross over
the hill into the next area.  In here, grab the items in the center.  Use your
Rocket Launcher to take out any charging Bulls, then use the Tommygun or more
rockets to kill the Skeletons.  Use the Rocket Launcher to clean up after that,
then grab the new set of items in the center.  Use the Tommygun to kill the
many, many Kamikazes approaching.  Take cover near the building if you must.
When the wave is over, grab the backpack in the center, then switch to the
Rocket Launcher again to kill the new set of enemies near the building.
Finally, the door to the building is open!  Go in and get the Lasergun.  Use it
to kill the many spawning enemies, including Skeletons, a few Mechanoids(try
directing their fire to take out the other enemies), and some Reptilioids.  Be
sure to kill the enemies up high on pedestals first - it can be hard to keep
track of their projectiles.  Take the door to exit the level.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

In these slums, start by hugging the wall and circling around.  Enemies are
randomly scattered around here, so kill any in your immediate vicinity first,
then kill any enemies you can see on the rooftops.  You can find many secrets
by hugging the wall, so stick to it.  The exit is directly forward from the
entrance, so grab as many items and kill as many enemies as you want before you
leave.  This next courtyard is very similar, only larger.  The exit is straight
forward - visit this first.  You find that it is locked.  From the middle, if
you turn directly left and walk forward, you will find a switch on a little
pedestal - push it.  If you turn around from here(or turn right from the
center)and walk forward, you will find the other switch.  After both of these
have been pressed, you can enter the sewer directly forward from the entrance
to this courtyard.  Be sure to hug the outside wall to look for secrets first.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

This is a gloomy level, filled with dangerous pools and creepy corridors.
Start by diving straight down and going forward into a very beneficial secret
corridor.  Resurface on the other side.  Jump on the platform and kill the
enemies in the immediate area.  When you climb the stairs, a blitz of frogs
comes at you, so step back and mow them down with your Tommygun.  If you
Analyze the door, you find that it is locked.  Turn around and try to jump onto
the raised platform with a shield to the right.  After succeeding or failing,
dive into the water and press the button on the post farthest away from the
locked door.  Resurface and enter the door.

In the next room, watch out for the many, many frogs around the area.  Once you
get the armors in the area, take the right path and follow the sewer around.
When you reach a down-sloping, lighted room, be careful!  Step back and kill
any enemies you can, especially the electric fish.  Swim on down and follow the
sewer around.  The fish in here are really brutal - try using the Grenade
Launcher to handle them.  The exit is somewhere to the right - just don't turn
completely around and you'll be fine.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Kill the monsters, climb the ramp, and follow the perimeter of the square.
Once you get the items, follow the path around and into the next courtyard.
Use your rocket launcher for this area, even for the Harpies.  After you kill
the enemies, some items generate in the center.  Take them and go inside the
building.  After you get the items inside, enter the next courtyard.  To open
the exit door, you must collect four scarabs(note: the following directions are
relative to north being the direction in front of you from this entrance).  The
first one is in a little room forward from the entrance.  To get the second
one, go right from the entrance and go a little right - the entrance to the
room will be to the east.  The next one is almost directly opposite from that
one.  The last one is off to the east again - enter from the south.  The
enemies in the area mostly consist of Rocketeers and Grunts, so you shouldn't
have a problem.  Take the exit to the north.

The next area is a long alleyway with enemies attacking from all sides.  Take
it very slowly.  Look out for any Reptilioids up high.  When you reach a pit,
you will see that Bulls are charging at you.  To cross the pit, let one
approach, then quickly jump on and across the platform that covers the pit when
it cross.  Continue forward - at the end, after a long series of scattered
Bulls and Skeletons, you will soon be overwhelmed by a few hundred
Skeletons(!).  Use your new Minigun until the supply is exhausted, then do
whatever else you can to control the mob.  Rockets can be efficient, as long as
you don't blow yourself up.

The next courtyard is another series of waves of enemies...again, cardinal
directions are relative to the entrance.
Wave 1: Kamikazes, from all directions.  Find a nice corner to protect
        yourself.  They may spawn near you, but the center of this place is NOT
        safe.  Us your Tommygun if you have any bullets, or use your Colts to
        conserve ammo.  This lasts about three minutes.  Afterwards, a
        backpack, some armor, and health spawns in the center.
Wave 2: A bunch of Harpies, starting from the north and then from the west,
        east, and south.  Use the regular strategy for them - get them in a
        nice group and fire a rocket into the pack.  After that, kill the
        stragglers.
Wave 3: A row of Harpies from the south.  Grab the items in the center
        afterwards.
Wave 4: A row of Bulls approaches from the north.  Run to a corner and do what
        you can, then circle around.  Collect the backpack in the center.
Wave 5: A row of Skeletons from the north, commanded by a Bio-Mechanoid.  USE
        ROCKETS.
Wave 6: A row of Skeletons from the north.
Wave 7: A row of Skeletons from the north, commanded by a Bio-Mechanoid.
Wave 8: A row of Skeletons from the north.
Wave 9: A row of Skeletons from the north, commanded by a Bio-Mechanoid.  After
        this one, the door finally opens!  Take the exit.

You've lost all your weapons, so you'll have to start over.  Grab the various
items in front of you, then break up your Shotgun.  One barrel will suffice for
awhile.  Take out the scattered Knarrs and Grunts - they relly do come from
everywhere.  As you continue forward, the next set of items spawns more Grunts
and a few Kamikazes.  The next set of items is much farther in the distance.
When you grab them, some Grunts and one Werebull spawn - let the Werebull run
over most of the Grunts!  The next set spawns a Bio-Mechanoid and some of his
little buddies.  The next set includes the Cannon, which is the most powerful
weapon in the game.  Test it out - fire it so that it rolls through a Bull to
the Mechanoid behind it.  This is a very useful weapon, so don't use all your
Cannonballs all at once!

In the courtyard ahead, you again go through a series of waves of enemies...

Wave One: Kamikazes and Skeletons.  Use your pistols and the Shotgun.  After
          the wave, a heart and some ammo spawns in the center.
Wave Two: Bulls from all directions.  After this one, a door opens to the
          north - go through it and get all the items inside.

When you go through the door in that room, you find another huge courtyard.
There are four platforms on which you must put the runes you've collected.  You
will find one platform in each corner of the level.  Every time you place a
rune, a bunch of assorted enemies appear, including Bio-Mechanoids, Knarrs,
grunts, Reptilioids, and Kamikazes. It gets quite hectic at times, so be
careful!

After you place all four runes, grab all the items in the center.  A HUGE enemy
appears in front of you - this is the Lava Golem.  Break out your cannon and
fire straight at him until he runs out of health.  You now have to deal with
the mini-Lava Golems around the place.  Use your Lasergun to finish them off.
After that, go through the door and finish the level.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Grab the backpack, then enter the next room.  Grunts, frogs, and bulls appear
in this room.  Once you deal with the mass of frogs, enter the next room.  Go
either left or right and around to the next courtyard.  The door to the north
is inaccessible at the moment, so enter the room to the east.  In this
courtyard, you must press the buttons to the east and west, then enter the room
to the north.  The courtyard spawns Bio-Mechanoids, Skeletons, and even a
little Lava Golem.  The northern room contains mostly grunts and Gnaars.  When
you leave the room, you meet another Lava Golem - use your rockets to quickly
dispose of him, then switch to the Minigun and take out the Reptilioid across
the courtyard.  Go back through the entrance and enter the newly accessible
door.  There are two side rooms with a few items and enemies, but you need to
press all the buttons around the column in the middle to open the next door.
If the Use option doesn't appear against the button, step back a little and
look up at it.

Enter the next room.  In here, you see an Arachnoid sleeping in the center of
the room guarding an ankh.  Use the Cannon to give it a jump-start, then use
your Minigun to kill it and its minions(mostly grunts and Frogs).  Enter the
next room.  You see a Heart in the center - if you grab it, the doors close
around you, the floor becomes foggy, and increasingly difficult enemies appear
in pairs for awhile.  When the doors open, grab the items to the sides and
enter the next courtyard.  The northern door doesn't open, so go west...

In the west courtyard, you will see a large obelisk in the center.  If you go
forward, a Lava Golem will appear - use the Cannon if you can.  When you grab
the items to the sides, enemies ALWAYS appear.  This can be tough, so try
short-cutting around these by swimming straight through the center of the pool.
The entrance to the next area is in the pond on the northern wall.  When you
swim through the tube down there, you enter another courtyard.  Enter the room
in front of you, grab the Amon statue, then take the teleport exit back to the
courtyard with the obelisk.  Fight the enemies or swim past them.  Enter the
courtyard with the locked door.  You now find a Lava Golem and his minions
inhabiting this courtyard, so break out your Cannon again.  Enter the
previously locked door.  You find a room PACKED with items.  Grab as much as
you can, then go around the corner into the courtyard.

In this courtyard, you have to deal with another massive Frog attack.  Run
around in circles, using the entire room.  Break out your Tommygun, then use a
quick rocket to thin out the pack when you can.  When you finish, you have to
deal with a massive Kamikaze attack!  This can be one of the most stressful
moments of the game.  Try to find a safe place, then use your Tommygun to take
them down.  Luckily, killing them often sets off a nice chain reaction.  When
you finish them off, destroy the statues in the room and grab their hidden
items.  Analyze the door, then step to the sides, forcing the Bull to run into
it.  In the next courtyard, you have to deal with more waves of enemies...

Wave One: Kamikazes from all sides.
Wave Two: Bone Skeletons from all sides.  After this, Arachnids appear on the
          two southern platforms, then armor appears on the ground.
Wave Three: A long line of Harpies appear from the northern sky.  They then
            appear from the south, then two Arachnids appear on the southern
            platforms.  Grab the armor in the center.
Wave Four: Three Bio-Mechanoids appear to the north, then Bulls appear from the
           south.  While you battle them, Bio-Mechanoids appear from the east
           and west.

After that, enter the northern door and exit the level.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

This level is a bit more puzzling than the rest, but that isn't saying much.
Enter the first courtyard.  Gnarrs and Skeletons charge forth from the door in
front of you.  When they stop spawning, go through the doors.  In this
courtyard, go around the statue and kill the two Bio-Mechanoids up high.  You
now need to pick up two important items...enter the door on the left(from the
entrance) on the southern side of the room.  In this courtyard, go inside the
little building.  When you leave it, three Lava Golems appear in the yard.
Break out the Cannon and take down the big ones, then switch to the Shotgun to
kill the little ones.  Enter the next room.  There is one main building in the
center - before you get inside, you need to press three buttons on the sides.
You have to deal with Bulls, Arachnoids, Skeletons, and Bio-Mechanoids as you
travel around the place.  When you press them all, go inside.  Climb the stairs
and go through the doorway onto a platform.  Follow the path around the
perimeter of the room.  You find the Golden Heart at the top.  To leave this
place, go from the room in the center to another pathway.  On the path, you
find a doorway back to the room with the statue.  Note: there is a cool little
secret to the right of that doorway...if you get on its jump-pad, you go flying
around and back to the doorway.

Anyway, now that you're back in the courtyard with the statue in the center,
take the opposite door, to the right of the center.  Inside the door is another
large courtyard with Bio-Mechanoids, Arachnoids, and Reptilioids.  Once you
clear the courtyard, enter the door.  It's another vaguely puzzling courtyard.
Climb the stairs and follow the pathway around.  You find the Feather on a
pedestal.  Once you collect it, Harpies and Skeletons appear to hassle you.
Take a door in the corner of the room, like in the last courtyard.

Now that you're back in the courtyard, take the previously locked door.
Analyze the door in the center, then take the west path upward.  Follow the
path, but stick to the narrow corridors - you find a Gold Ankh at the end.
Return to the first room and enter the door in the center.  Inside, you find a
spiky pit.  Fall in it once, and you find a nice secret area with armor, ammo,
and such...fall in it again, and you die.  Go across the spiky pit and into the
door.  An obelisk rises from the center.  Kill the enemies and go to the
opposite side of the room.  Get the ancient papyrus and enter the ammunition
depot.  The room after it is quite tough.

In here, you must collect four gold Ankhs and return them to the pedestals in
the center.  They appear one-at-a-time, and they're a little hard to find, so
here are their locations:
                   exit

                                     3
                 entrance

Every time you pick one up and place it in the center, enemies spawn, including
Arachnoids, Skeletons, Reptilioids, Bulls, and Bio-Mechanoids.  Switch between
using your Rocket Launcher and the Minigun for this room.

Once you place all the Ankhs, the door opens.  Go straight inside if you want
to go to the next level; take a left as soon as you enter to take a side-trip
to the Sacred Yards...

Grab the Backpack and go forward.  Bio-Mechanoids appear from all sides, as
well as a few frogs and Skeletons.  Go forward some more, and a few Harpies
come at you.  Round the corner and enter the room.  You have to deal with a
short wave of frogs and some invisible(!) Gnaars.  Go into the next room.  In
here, you find a few Arachnoids, Bio-Mechanoids, and invisible Gnaars.  Go in
the water and go through a tube.  Go up the ramp into a room.  In here, you
can't leave because there are some bars over the door.  Press the buttons on
all four of the statues and go in the next corridor.

You have a little puzzle-solving to do in here.  Analyze the thing in the
center.  Go through the left door for your first puzzle.  There are three
buttons in three corners on the roof to press - don't worry; when you approach
them, you will flip upside-down to stand on the ceiling.  A few tough enemies
appear, but some of them are quite small.  Grab the Gold Sphinx up the ramp,
then exit the room.  Go across to the other puzzle room.  In here, go straight
forward(but not over the button on the floor) and press the button on the wall.
Go back and push that button on the floor, then go back to the platform and
press another button.  Repeat this one more time.  Swim to the platform in the
northwest corner.  Grab the Gold Sphinx.  Two Reptilioids spawn, so deal with
them on your way out and return to the central room.  The thing in the center
opens up, and you drop in.

| [15.13] The Great Pyramid - Level 13                                        |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Here it is, the final level.  This is as unrelenting as the previous levels,
and then some.  Go forward for awhile, and you will find the main corridor
with two pyramids to the sides and three pedestals in the center.  On these
pedestals are a backpack and health.  These constantly regenerate with time, so
take them WHENEVER YOU NEED THEM.  Soon after you enter, the waves of enemies
start coming...

Wave One: ~130 Kleer Skeletons.  Use the Rocket Launcher as your main weapon.
Wave Two: ~100 Bulls.  This is where it gets intense!  Run around in circles
          and use your Cannon, trying to take out a line of them with every
          shot.  Near the end of the wave, they go in a square around the
          place.  Get into the square and take rows of them out at a time.
Wave Three: ~70 Bio-Mechanoids.  Use your Cannon and the Lasergun.
Wave Four: ~30 final Skeletons.  This shouldn't be a problem!

Since the Backpacks regenerate, you can really use whatever weapons you want.
Switch back and forth between your favorites, then grab a Backpack whenever you
feel like it.  When you finish, go through the opened door...

Now the boss himself appears behind you.  He's one big guy, but he's not your
main problem yet.  After the cutscene ends, go forward on the path.  All sorts
of enemies appear while you travel on the path - break out the Cannon to thin
out the pack of Bulls, then finish them off with the Minigun or Lasergun.
Switch to the Rocket Launcher for the Bio-Mechanoids, then use the Lasergun for
the Skeletons.  Use whatever you can, then make it to the top of the pyramid!
From here, fire your Cannon at Ugh-Zan III until his health dips into the red
zone.  If you run out of Cannonballs, switch to the Lasergun, then the Minigun,
then the Rocket Launcher.  As for his attacks, don't worry about them too much;
the Cannon will rip through the rocks and missiles, and the Lasergun and
Minigun will easily dispatch them.  Sidestep to avoid his blue lasers.  Once
his health goes red, turn around and enter the pyramid...

After a nice cutscene, you emerge on the spaceship.  Now it's time to finish
him off!  Run to one of the corners immediately.  Take the item there, then get
on one of the Jump Pads.  It will launch you through a weird hoop if you don't
move out of the way.  Go to the next corner, then launch through the next hoop.
Keep on going around the perimeter until you've gone through all the hoops.
Then, try to lure Ugh-Zan into the center of the arena.  In a few seconds, a
giant charge will zap him, costing him a large amount of his health.  Repeat as
necessary.  This attack alone won't be enough - constantly fire your Cannon
at him.  His attacks are pretty simple to avoid.  Eventually, he'll die...

Hatshepsut Temple
1. From the starting point, turn right and head towards the recess.  Some
critters will spawn, so be careful.  Once on the recess, pick up the second
Shofield.
-- Submitted by Jesse.

2. Instead of going up the ramp, go down the ramp that is behind you. Once
down, half turn right and head the way you’re supposed to go. You should come
to a door. (The door is on the right side of the ramp) These guys with big
heads will come representing the game’s programmers. Kill em, and then go down
the ramp for some gear.
-- Submitted by Jesse.

3. Same as 2, but on the left side of the ramp. Blow the door up with the
rocket launcher on the next secret.
-- Submitted by Jesse.

4. At the starting point, go up the ramp, and then turn right. Jump on the
ledge to the right of you and then jump up on the roof where the first secret
was. You’ll find a rocket launcher.
-- Submitted by Jesse.

5. Same as 4, but on the left side. You’ll find some rockets.
-- Submitted by Jesse.

6. Go down the ramp behind you. Go into the desert. You’ll encounter Bio-Mechs.
You’ll find an oasis with awesome stuff.
-- Submitted by Jesse.

7. The last secret is behind the temple. Go up the ramp at the start,
turn right, and follow the temple’s perimeter you will eventually come to a
wall. Part of it is darkened. Touch the darkened spot for a Double Barrel.

Below is all the information I have collected from a variety of people.
Some may be repeats, but worded differently.

"directly to the right of the start there is a second .45 that is secret #1
if you go down the ramp behind you and to the right at the bottom (don't go
in to the desert yet..) there is a door secret #2. on the other side of the
courtyard is another door that wont open....perhaps a few rockets would
help. the rocket launcher is easy to get. go up both ramps then make an
immediate right. you have to jump on the wall that faces your start position
then to a platform on the right. there is your rocket launcher. there is
also a platform on the other side that has some extra rockets. behind the
top area of the temple is a secret right where you get the armor in the back
right area. secret #3 then you have armor and rockets and a launcher. now
you can go to the desert and tackle the 4 robots there. but beware after
getting the heart the first time I played, I got attacked by about a dozen
witches....but haven't had that happen again since. weird. secret #4 go back
to the door that wouldn't open and use the rocket launcher to open it.
secret #5" - Submitted by Chris, melsbells@cfl.rr.com

--------------------

"1) On the left side of the map (the side with the golden heart), there's a
spot where an arachnid sits on a moving pillar and comes shooting at you
when you pick up some armor. In that area, there is a small building. Go
inside it and pick up the green health bottle. You need to actually pick it
up, not just walk over it. The ceiling will start to come down, so get out
quick. Once the ceiling drops, go back in and pick up the powerups that
were on the ceiling.

2) In the back right corner of the heart of gold area, up on the ledge by
the door to exit the area, there is a bounce pad that bounces you up to a
green health bottle. There is another bouncer there that bounces you onto
the roof above the door you entered the area from.

4) On the right side of the map (the half with the feather), in the area
before the area that contains the feather, there are 5 tower/pillar things
rising out of the ground. You can blow two of these up. When you do, you'll
get a message about secret cannon ammo being revealed and some cannonballs
will appear.

8) At the very end of the level, pass through the doors but immediately turn
left and head through the side door on the left. Don't go too far in or
you'll trigger the normal level exit. The exit on the left will take you to
the Sacred Yards." - Submitted by Mario C., createur@videotron.ca
