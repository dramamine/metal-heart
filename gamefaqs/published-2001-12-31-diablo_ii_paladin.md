===============================================================================
NEWS: Diablo II has changed vastly as a game.  This may be good for the game
itself and the players by keeping things fresh, but it has made it impossible
for me to keep this guide current.  I don't even enjoy the game any more!  As
a result, I am finished with this guide.  I won't take it down - I'll leave it
up for anyone who still plays an older version of the game.  Please don't send
me any email concerning the changes in the game or any problems with the guide.

*******************
What is this guide?
*******************
This is a detailed guide for the Paladin class in Diablo II.  Diablo II is an
RPG brought to you by Blizzard Entertainment.  The Paladin is one of the five
classes in the game, and this guide will explore every nook and cranny of being
a Paladin.

**************************
Why should I be a Paladin?
**************************
Paladin is the most strategically demanding class.

If you play online, everyone will want you in the party, no matter what level
you are(99% true).

There are too many Necromancers and Barbarians already!

You are a natural party leader.

You've always wanted to be like a knight from the Middle Ages.

***************
What are auras?
***************
This is quite important...an aura is something that affects you and anybody in
a certain radius.  A Paladin can use one aura at once, and has a choice between 
twenty different auras.  Each aura has a different affect on you and your
party.  You can choose which aura to use in each situation.

***********************************
Can I use this guide on my website?
***********************************
It depends.  Here's how it is:

YOU MUST E-MAIL ME(slodeth@iname.com) AND ASK FOR PERMISSION!

You may not make any changes to it.  You can ask, but the answer will be "no"
 in almost every case.

You cannot make it seem like you wrote the guide yourself IN ANY WAY.  It must
 be clear that it is my original work.

You may not re-write it yourself in your own style.  It's called plagiarism.
 Even if you change every word, plagiarism is the theft of IDEAS.

If I grant you permission by E-mail, you should give me an E-mail address which
 I can inform you about updates to the guide.

If I grant you permission by E-mail, you should give me a hyperlink to the web
 site on which you post the guide.

If you follow each of these steps above, you will almost certainly be given
permission.

**********************
Can I send you E-mail?
**********************
Yes, but PLEASE read the Contact Info section at the bottom of the guide!


=================
1. PALADIN SKILLS
=================
Before we start, I need to clarify a few things...

Every aura will have its name, requirements, a statistical chart, description,
advantages, and disadvantages listed.

The charts go to level 30, but you can only put 20 points into each skill.
There's more about that in the FAQ at the bottom.

All radii(radius plural) are in yards, and all durations are in seconds.

Might is very simple-it adds to your damage.  Your damage is increased by the
percent listed.

Advantages: Obvious!
Disadvantages: Not as good as Concentration, which is worth waiting for.

Holy fire deals fire damage to any enemy in its radius.

Advantages: Deal damage without even attacking.
Disadvantages: Very weak.  Useless in Nightmare and Hell.

* NOTE: this skill is enhanced by Magefists, which is primarily a Sorceress item.
It might not be a good idea to use them, but it's interesting!

For every hit taken from the enemy, the amount of damage given to you is given
back to the enemy, times the percent.  This is extremely powerful and useful.

Advantages: Kill enemies without taking a swing!  Useful against enemies of any
 level.
Disadvantages:  You still take damage, so it might not be wise to have a
strategy based on you taking damage.  It doesn't work with ranged attacks.

30    |   495%    |  46

*Note that no radius is displayed in the game.  The radius listed is assumed to
be the same as Thorns and various other skills.

Concentration increases your damage.  This becomes a powerful aura very
quickly and is a wise investment.  It also makes 20% of your attacks
uninterruptable, which means that an enemy's attack will not stop your attack
from connecting.  The radius is not displayed by the game, so this is a rough
estimate.

Advantages: Very useful.  L13 Concen beats L20 Might.
Disadvantages: Not helpful if you can't score a hit.

This spell will freeze and slow your enemies.

Advantages: Most useful of the Holy spells.  Useful in Nightmare and Hell.
 Since the enemy is slowed, they make fewer attacks and are easier to hit.
Disadvantages: Increases in effectiveness quickly.  I recommend stopping around
 L10.

CLARIFICATION: Every time you do damage, 8% of the damage comes back around to
you.  This can be deadly if you do high damage, and yes, you can Sacrifice 
yourself to death, so be careful.

Advantages: Each hit does alot of damage, and it's powerful even at L1.  Great
 with life-leech items.  In fact, if you can get over 8% life leech, this is the
 perfect skill for you.
Disadvantages: Most people aren't willing to spend their life for an attack.  If
 you can't get the life leech, be very careful.

***Thanks to Yohu "Genjuro" Zayirebatsu for clarifying this skill.  He's argued
with me about the usefulness of this spell, but I'll stick to my opinions.  There 
are many people out there who swear by this spell, so you should form your own
opinion on this one.

Zeal is a multiple-hit attack.  Instead of taking a single-swing, you will take
several swings in quick succession.  It also increases your attack rating.

Advantages: Low mana cost.  Very useful for situations in which many enemies
 are around you at once.  Great in the early levels.
Disadvantages: After you begin the sequence of hits, you cannot hit any enemies
 that start attacking you during the sequence.  This means that if you use Zeal
 against a single enemy, then a group of enemies surrounds you soon after, you
 will not be able to hit any of them, but you will swing at them anyway.  This
 wastes valuable time and can get you killed.  For this reason, you should not
 invest many points in Zeal.

Blessed Hammer is a projectile that spirals outward, dealing damage to any
enemy it touches.

Advantages: Paladin's best projectile attack.
Disadvantages: Projectile attacks are obviously not Paladin's strong point.

* UPDATE * I really underestimated this skill.  Zealous-Knight wrote a decent
guide at http://www.planetdiablo.com/diablo2/characters/paladin/strategy/zealous/
Basically, it says that using Hammer and Concentration is a great combination.
He's right on this one, and many up-and-coming Paladins are trying this one out.

When you hit an enemy while using Conversion, there is a chance that the enemy
will become converted to your side for a duration of time.  This means the
enemy will fight for you against your enemies.

Advantages: Quite useful for evening the odds when you're overwhelmed.  Enemies
 often die before Conversion runs out of time.
Disadvantages: When Conversion runs out, if the enemy doesn't die, the aura you
 use will stay on for about five seconds.  This can be dangerous if, for
 example, you hit your own Thorns.  Was nerfed with the 1.03 patch(not as
 effective).  The v1.03 values are displayed, which are roughly 1/3 less.

Holy Shield increases your defense and the % Chance To Block of your shield.
Your shield is replaced with a white holy graphic.

Advantages: Great for anyone who uses a shield.  Not an aura, so you can turn
 it on each time the duration runs out.
Disadvantages: Useless if you use two-handed weapons.

Fist of the Heavens is another projectile attack.  When the first bolt hits an
enemy, it will scatter into several bolts aimed at other enemies on screen.

Advantages: Useful when many enemies are on the screen, since other bolts are
 sent out after the first one.
Disadvantages: Takes way too much mana, not very efficient.

----------------------------------------
How should I distribute my skill points?
----------------------------------------
Here's a list of the skills and how I feel about investing in each of them.

Note that when I say "no points," it really means "zero or one point" depending
on whether or not you want the later skills.  If another skill that you want
requires one of these skills, give it a point.


Prayer-No points.  It really isn't useful enough.
Resist Fire/Cold/Lightning-No points.  Save your points for Salvation.  You can
 put one point in each if you wish, but it would be better in the long run to
 skip these three.
Defiance-Not a bad aura, but I don't recommend investing in it.
Cleansing-No points.  Too selective!
Vigor-No points.  Stamina shouldn't be a problem.
Meditation-No points.  Useful in Multiplayer if you play with Sorceresses, but
 they generally can take care of themselves.
Redemption-As many as you wish, but I recommend around or less than ten.  This 
 aura is simply amazing in Single Player, but Necromancers will hate you in
 Multiplayer if you use up their corpses.
Salvation-Several points.  This spell is very useful, but it doesn't increase
 in power very much in the higher levels.  At level five, it only raises by one
 percent or less for each point.  Use your best judgment.

Might-No points.  Save up for Concentration.
Holy Fire/Shock-No points.  Do you want to poke your enemies instead of fight
 them?  I didn't think so.
Holy Freeze-Up to you.  Seven should be enough if you want to invest in it.
 I don't find it that useful.
Thorns-Twenty!  Most higher-level Paladins use this with Conversion.  It gets
 the job done, period.  I don't like it that much, but most people do.
 Necromancers appreciate it the most.
Concentration-Twenty!  People like this one too, especially Barbarians.  It
 might not be as useful in Single Player, but this is my favorite aura.
Blessed Aim-Your call.  I don't like it very much, since I invest many points
 in Dexterity.
Sanctuary-No points.  Too limited.
Fanaticism-All or nothing.  Good choice if you use two-handed weapons, bad
 choice if you use Vengeance.
Conviction-Slumps off at level nine, so keep it under there.

Sacrifice-Has potential, but I say "no points" to this one unless you can get
 enough life leeching to make it worthwhile.
Holy Bolt/Fist of the Heavens-No points.  Not powerful enough.
Blessed Hammer-All or nothing.  If you need to have a projectile weapon, this
 is the one.
Smite-One point, for the invincible enemies.  This may be more of a
 superstition, but one point can't hurt.
Zeal-Just a few points.  It really does help, but too many points can be very
 dangerous.
Charge-All or nothing.  This is the attack of choice for many Paladins, and
 it is a wise investment.  I can't get used to the way it works, but if you
 can, it will serve you well.
Vengeance-Not too many points.  My attack of choice, for better or for worse.
Conversion-It's up to you.  This is a wise investment, even though it just
 got nerfed with the last patch.  I've got five points in it.
Holy Shield-Your choice.   Don't waste your points if you've got a great shield 
or if you don't use a shield.

Remember, you can't use each of these skills!  Choose a few skills to invest in,
but just a few!  If you spread your points too thin, you won't be strong enough
later in the game.  In the end, the choice is yours...

2. Other Paladin Questions
==========================

**********************************************************
WHAT ARE SOME GENERAL PATHS TO TAKE WHEN MAKING A PALADIN?
**********************************************************
(Steel Goat convinced me to do a section like this...hope it helps.)

In this section, I'll discuss a few of the general strategies used when making
a Paladin.  Good strategies usually involve a primary attacking skill, one
secondary(as a backup plan), and the skills that will back them up.  Anything 
else is either too specific or it spreads the points too thinly.  I'll organize
it like this, then list the pros and cons.  I want this to be more of a guide 
based on user submissions, since I can't research all this stuff myself!  If you
have a "general path" to submit, send it over to slodeth@iname.com with a 
subject line like "Diablo II Paladin Path" and I'll add it here when I get 
around to it.  Please put it in a format somewhat like the one here.

It was really strange for me to think about the skills like this - by taking a
skill and working around it.  It really puts everything in perspective.  You
should try it too!  You can't just look at a list of skills and decide which
ones you want for your Paladin - you have to pick the ones that will be the most
useful, or your skill points will be a waste.


 -------
/ PRIMARY: Zeal         SUPPORT: Fanaticism or Concentration, Thorns

I'm not a big fan of Zeal-based Paladins, since I started out with one and fell
flat on my face.  While it seems like a great idea when you begin the game to
use a bunch of attacks at a time, it just doesn't work out as well as it should.
Later on in the game, if you leave Zeal going for too long, you will get
surrounded.  The surrounding enemies will wail on you, and you won't even be
able to run away!  Still, with Fanaticism, these multiple attacks will go very
quickly, so if you invest less than ten points in Zeal, you can certainly be
effective and efficient.  Use a one-handed weapon to keep everything swift.    /
 -------                                                                -------
/ PRIMARY: Conversion  SUPPORT: THORNS, Charge or Vengeance, Vigor or Defiance

This is my first successful path.  To pull this off in a large group, you
simply need to Convert one enemy, switch to Thorns, then Convert a few more
while the Converts distract the rest of them.  The enemies start disappearing
pretty quickly!  The only problem with this is trying to get that first Convert
without dying.  I don't use it myself, but I would recommend some way to get out
of the fire quickly like Vigor, or some way to protect yourself in the fire like
Defiance or Holy Shield.  I use Holy Shield myself, but alone, it isn't enough./
 -------                                                                -------
/ PRIMARY: Blessed Hammer   SUPPORT:  Concentration

I read a well-written guide by a "Hammerdin" when they were popping up on the
net, but the link has since disappeared.  To explain it, Concentration increases
the power of Blessed Hammer, making it a lethal killing machine!  Some versions
of the game didn't list this change in the Stats page, but the difference was
there.  Of course, the skill isn't effective alone, since you can't aim it.
Use it to thin out the pack, then use a regular attack skill, like Charge or
Fanaticism.                                                                    /
 -------                                                                -------
/ PRIMARY: Charge, Sacrifice    SUPPORT: Concentration

If you're going to be a melee fighting-based Paladin, Concentration is an 
obvious skill choice.  As for the attack itself, Charge and Sacrifice are two
great choices.  While Sacrifice seems like a bad idea at first, an item or two
with life leech should solve this.  This skill has great potential, so don't
write it off as a useless skill.  Charge is also a great idea, if you don't mind
using the hit-and-run technique.  Use a two-handed weapon with these skills.   /
 -------                                                                -------




****************************
What equipment should I use?
****************************
The game is designed so that a Paladin should use a scepter(Scepter, Grand
Scepter, or Divine Scepter), since these generally add to your skills.  You can
use a scepter along with a shield.  However, scepters generally don't do enough
damage.  You may want to use a powerful two-handed weapon, such as a maul or an
executioner's sword.  This will do much more damage, but will compromise your
skills and your defense.

You should make a decision at this point based on your skills.  If you plan on
using Conversion, I recommend a scepter because damage will not be important to
you.  Scepters will attack fast, which is just what you need.  If you plan on
using Charge or Vengeance, go with a two-handed weapon since each hit will cost
mana, and you want to do as much damage as possible with each hit.

Of course, you can't expect to find exactly what you need.  You may want to
remain flexible and use the best weapons that you find.  If you do this, make
sure the skills you select are well-rounded, so you can use one or two-handed
weapons at all times.

All the equipment besides your weapon isn't complicated-use the best things you
can find.  If you use attacks which take plenty of mana, find a mana-leeching
ring or shield.  Find boots with fast walk/run so you don't have to rely on
Vigor.  Use your own discretion for everything else.

*********************************
How should I distribute my stats?
*********************************
Again, this depends on how you want to play.  If you use Conversion, put most
of your points in Dexterity so you get more hits.  If damage is more important
to you, put your points in Strength.  I recommend putting 170 points into
Strength so you can use the best armor in the game(generally), the Ornate
Plate.  Don't go over 170 though, since the other stats are important too.  You
may not need to put any points into energy unless mana is a big problem for
you.

***********************************
How do I get my skills to level 30?
***********************************
Level 20 is the maximum for skills, but you can use equipment to get your
skills above twenty.  Level 30 is really much too high, and I used it more as
a theoretical reference, but this is how you could do it:
Weapon:  At least a scepter with +2 to all Paladin skill levels
Armor: Silks of the Victor(+1 Skills, unique ancient armor)
Rings: Two Stones of Jordan(+1 Skills each, unique ring)
Shield: Sigon's Guard(+1 Skills, set item)
Amulet: Priest's Amulet(+2 Paladin Skills)
Helmet: Tarnhelm(+1 Skills, unique skull helm)
That's +9...then just go to a Skills Shrine to get up to 31.

Of course, this is pretty much impossible in Single Player.  Only players on
Multiplayer should even try to get this.

*********************************
How should I play in Multiplayer?
*********************************
First and foremost, behave respectfully.  There are enough assholes online
already, so be nice.  The manual identifies Paladins as natural party leaders,
so act like one!  Take charge if you must, but adapt to everybody else and
their situation.  

Choose your aura based on the other people in your party.  A Necromancer with
minions will find Thorns most useful, Barbarians will prefer Concentration, and
Sorceresses will prefer Meditation.  Ask if you can't decide for yourself.

Stick with the group.  You don't need to be the first one into battle, but
remember that every aura has a radius, so keep your party within the radius.

*****************************************************
What should I do when the party has several Paladins?
*****************************************************
The special things about auras is that they will stack, i.e. each aura will
affect each party member at the same time.  If two Paladins, one with Thorns
and one with Might, for example, stand near each other, they both are affected
by Might and Thorns at the same time.  The graphic switches back and forth, but
the effects are still there.  However, if both Paladins use Might, only one
Might will do anything at one time.

For large groups of Paladins, it is recommended that you do an Aura Check
before you begin.  Talk to the other Paladins and discuss which aura everyone
will use so that everyone uses a different aura.  With everyone using a
different aura, you can be affected by up to eight auras at once!

*************************
What about Hardcore Mode?
*************************
Personally, I'm scared to even touch it!  If you really want to try out
Hardcore Mode, play through in Normal Mode until you feel like you know
absolutely EVERYTHING about being a Paladin.  Then, sit down and plan
everything out(skills, stats, at what level to do each act).  I recommend a
program called the Diablo II Character Planner(check planetdiablo.com or
fileplanet.com), which lets you plan out skills and such.  You need to find a
strategy that is unstoppable!

*******************
What about dueling?
*******************
* UPDATE * I plan to make this section based on user submissions.  Send them
to slodeth@iname.com with the subject line "Diablo II Dueling" or something.
Also, include how you would like to be identified in here.  I won't put your
email address in here unless you request it.


While you don't see too many good dueling Paladins, it is not at all difficult
to win duels if you've invested in the right skills.  Charge, Concentration,
Thorns, and Holy Freeze are the most important skills for dueling.  Also, make
sure you use a high-damage weapon, such as a Pike or a Maul.  Here's a guide for
each character class...

VS AMAZONS

Charge and Concentration will work fine against them.  Get into a position where
they are at the edge of the screen and Charge.  You may want to use a potion
during the Charge in case you get hit by arrows.  Get a nice shield so you can
block a few arrows.

The other option is Holy Freeze instead of Charge.  IMHO, go with this one.  The
Amazon will try to stay out of the aura, so she won't get nearly as many shots
off.

"For example a charging pally these days can suffer to an amazon with Cleglaw's
Pincers (gloves that slow down the enemy 25%). Instead the best alternative 
would be an FOH *Fist of the Heavens* since the damage has been increased after
patch 1.08. My suggestion would be vigor , then holy freeze, then a Fist of the
Heavens to finish the zon, conviction could help as well. Yet if you were to 
attack with charge and concentration , first off you would move too slowly. 
Holy shield would also be helpful."  (submitted by: Steel Goat)


VS BARBARIANS

These are tough, especially since Whirlwind goes straight through your Charges.
Use Holy Freeze and run around until he runs low on mana.  Then, Charge in when
you can.  Use Thorns if you want to take the easy way out, but he'll get angry,
I promise!  In fact, most Barbs will tell you not to use Thorns at all.

*Note that Thorns is 1/10 as effective in Player vs Player matches.  Either rely
on Thorns less or put more points into it.

Zeal also works nicely against Barbs, but it's not a good investment.

VS NECROMANCERS

Use Holy Freeze, run away from Bone Spirits, and Charge when there's a good
opportunity.  Cleansing will help against Iron Maiden if you're willing to
invest the points.

Sanctuary is also a great idea, since it will damage all the minions.

VS PALADINS

This is like a game of rock/paper/scissors.  You can Charge, but you'll be dead
if he uses Thorns.  You can also wait for him to Charge and turn on Thorns.
My advice is to use a ranged attack, like Blessed Hammer or Holy Bolt.  This will
get him nervous and he'll Charge sooner, and you can switch to Thorns to kill
him.  The ranged attack doesn't need to be powerful if you're just trying to
scare him, but a powerful attack will be much more effective.

VS SORCERESSES

These aren't so hard.  Wait until her mana is depleted.  When she refills, Charge
in and you'll probably get a one-hit kill.  Most Sorceresses have low vitality.

Or, you can use high-level Salvation!  You won't take hardly any damage, since
the Sorc uses mostly elemental attacks.
