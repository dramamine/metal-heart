Look, I won't waste your time with a lot of commentary on these. This list is compiled from me searching my collection for '2012' and figuring out which albums I was still excited about. I included direct links to download all of these albums. (I do this in the interest of promoting bands I love. If you're a copyright owner who wants me to take a link down, contact me at dmca@mylifeismetal.com.) There's also a Spotify playlist that has my favorite tracks from all these albums, although it's missing some essentials, like "Take The Mirror" from White Lung.

I could really talk your ear off about all these releases, but how about you just hit Play instead? If you download things, be polite and say "thanks", but also be sure to bitch me out about how you can't believe Pig Destroyer didn't make the cut, or whatever.

**FLYING LOTUS** - <a href="../74/fu.rar">Until the Quiet Comes</a>
**HOLY OTHER** - <a href="../74/hh.rar">Held</a>
**HOW TO DRESS WELL** - <a href="../74/ht.rar">Total Loss</a>

<h3 style="text-align: right;">POST-ROCK</h3>
<a href="http://mylifeismetal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/folder.jpg"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-676" title="GYBE" src="http://mylifeismetal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/folder-150x150.jpg" alt="don't bend." width="150" height="150" /></a>

<h3>METAL</h3>
<a href="http://mylifeismetal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/folder.png"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-677" title="Converge - All We Love, We Leave Behind" src="http://mylifeismetal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/folder-150x150.png" alt="Converge - All We Love, We Leave Behind" width="150" height="150" /></a>
*** CONVERGE** - <a href="../74/ca.rar">All We Love We Leave Behind</a> (these guys get better and better. this album has a lot of 'thrash' elements to it, which are added in a unique way that few bands could pull off)
**ELDER** - <a href="../74/es.rar">Spires Burn</a> (not a full album, but some of the catchiest stoner metal tracks I've heard. check out if you want something bright and fun with sweet Sabbath-y riffs)
**ENSLAVED** - <a href="../74/er.rar">RIITIIR</a> (I haven't enjoyed a progressive metal album this much for many, many years)
**ERYN NON DAE** - <a href="../74/em.rar">Meliora</a> (intense from start to finish and just excellent all-around, check out if you like technical death metal)
**GLASS CLOUD** - <a href="../74/gr.rar">The Royal Thousand</a> (surprisingly good, catchy, non-lame metalcore band, feat. the guitarist from The Tony Danza Tapdance Extravaganza)
**GOJIRA** - <a href="../74/gl.rar">L'Enfant Sauvage</a> (one of the best melodic death bands around. I call them 'green metal' because they sing about saving the whales and being a good steward of this planet)
**KEHLVIN** - <a href="../74/ko.rar">The Orchard of Forking Paths</a> (doom/sludge with excellent riffs)
**KRALLICE** - <a href="../74/ky.rar">Years Past Matter</a>
**LOMA PRIETA** - <a href="../74/li.rar">I.V.</a> (meanest screamo)
**OLD MAN GLOOM** - <a href="../74/on.rar">NO</a> (supergroup: ex-Isis, Converge, Cave In)
