# Locrian

Lately I've been having this feeling, that as I continue on my journey to discover the heaviest metal in existence, that I've been looking in the wrong place.

Blastbeats? Riffs? Melodies? It's all played out.

There's something truly evil going on when you listen to "noise". You've left the world of songs and entered a world of compositions, of pieces. If any 'normals' hear what you hear, they're not just appalled; they're confused, they're offended. They can't understand why you would CHOOSE to listen to such a racket.

But you know why you listen to noise. It's so you can truly be engrossed in the sound, letting every layer build on the last until you're listening to an entire tower. It's so you can hear one wavelength and how it's affected by everything around it. It's so you can so fully occupy your brain that every other thought goes silent in the wake of noise.

Lately I've been digging into the back catalog of Locrian. There's a lot of good stuff in there! My favorite thing at the moment would be this "Rain of Ashes" track. I love the twinkly, evil descending scale thing going on at the 10-minute mark.

I really love the B-side of this album, which is a track called "Sehsa fo Niar". Because I am an idiot, I didn't even notice that this track was actually "Rain of Ashes" played backwards. I was just listening to the album over and over, thinking, "that second track is definitely my favorite."
