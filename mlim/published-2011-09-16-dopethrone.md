Let’s get back to basics here. You don’t need all that much to “bring it” when you’re a sludge metal band. Sometimes, less is more.

DOPETHRONE don’t even try to hide their Electric Wizard worship. You’ve heard the Wiz’s album Dopethrone, right? It’s kind of legendary, you know, for inventing stoner metal.* It’s got horror-movie samples too, maybe better ones. In fact, I think the sample in here, of some guy who called 911 after eating too much THC, is pretty dumb. And dated - I swear I heard that on Youtube months ago. But yeah, me and DOPETHRONE love Electric Wizard. Listen to that wah-pedal riffage four minutes in! That’s so Wizzy.

What I mostly love is that, at its core, you can hear just this drummer and fuzzmaster guitarist riffing out in their garage for hours on end, loving life. The riffs are huge, the drumming epic and aggressive. What more could you ask for?

Well, just one more thing. A sweet cover of "Ain't No Sunshine":
