**FALLUJAH**, currently melting my face.

Really digging this album "The Flesh Prevails" from **FALLUJAH**. Don't be an idiot like me and ignore these guys for having a dumb name. They're not what I expected at all (i.e. they're not Iraqi / not neocons) - just some straight-up progressive death metal. This is one of the best / heaviest albums I've heard since *ULCERATE* - "Vermis" last year. 5 out of 5 wolves.

Progressive death is not really something I'm super familiar with or psyched about - I guess it seems easy to do badly - but holy fuck, you can count me on board. I mean, I grew up listening to tons of prog-metal, but most of it just doesn't have _balls_, namsayin'? It's wussy singers, and bands generally tone back their heaviness while they're busting out some insane guitar solos.

But that brings us to **FALLUJAH**. They're not afraid to just add layers upon layers to their sound, creating something super-dense. Take the shift in tone at 2:20: most bands would be happy to add a crunchy riff to blisteringly-fast drums (a "breakdown", if you will), but even while that's going on, you've got a melodic guitar line and vocals at the same time.

Not to toot Satan's horn, but: metal fans are able to process way more of what's going on in a given track. We need MORE STIMULUS, more layers, more of everything. Think about it: your average non-heavy music fan will hear a track like this and process it as "noise". Yet, as a discerning metal listener, you can focus on each of the parts at your whim. You can hear the beauty surrounded by noise. SIDE NOTE: I can actually understand the lyrics of this band sometimes?!

I also dig the little flourishes of black metal, esp. on the track "Starlit Path" - reminds me a lot of ENSLAVED. Oh man, love that wailing on "Levitation" too.
