# am I actually supposed to blog about metal?

Because I'm really digging **THE OCEAN** right now. Specifically, the track _Grand Inquisitor II_, which every time I'm listening through the album, that track jumps out at me as being immediately awesome.  These guys are really talented - they are basically a prog-metal band (esp. with the whole 'ocean' theme) but they feel like a post-metal band, by way of concentrating on being melodic rather than super-aggressive.
