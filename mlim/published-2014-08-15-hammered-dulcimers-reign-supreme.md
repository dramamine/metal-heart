# Hammered Dulcimers Reign Supreme

It’s hard to hate-listen when there’s so much good metal coming out, right?

The new album “VI:Flora” by **BOTANIST** has been rocking my face lately. This band is TOTALLY WEIRD, yes, but if you’re down with something new and unique, headbang wif me:

What I love about this band is, they’re totally doing exactly the things black metal does, but the instrumentation is weird! All the blastbeats and tremolos and distortion are still there. It ends up sounding evil in a culty way. It makes me want to worship the gods of nature.

This new album reminds me a bit of **DEAFHEAVEN** – the song structure just has the same sort of drive to it, and the song-ending crescendos just stimulate the same parts in my brain.
