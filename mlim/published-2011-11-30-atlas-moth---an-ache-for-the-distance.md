Brandon Stosuy liked this album a lot, giving it the #26 slot on [http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/8717-best-albums-of-2011/](Pictchfork's Top 40 Metal Albums of 2011) list. We agree that this is the best song:

The title track has some sick riffs too:

I’ve been listening to this album a whole lot lately, trying to figure out how I feel about it. Pitchfork calls this album “post-everything”, which is a nice way of saying that this album is messy. It’s got a lot of different parts of metal happening at once – like an 80s thrasher trying their hand at black metal, or a Viking writing something to listen to away from the battle. Sometimes they just try to cram too many notes in there – I think the track "Gemini" just doesn’t work harmonically, for example. Oh, and the opening track, "Coffin Varnish" – songs have been written about every other aspect of coffins, so yeah, why not "Coffin Varnish" – is one of the weakest in my opinion. The riffs might actually be cool if they were fast, like Gothenburg-death-metal fast...but they’re not. Also, they have these stupid synths, just total waste of electricity. It sounds like Nintendo dungeon sounds, which I’ve already heard enough of from shitty metalcore bands like **SEE YOU NEXT TUESDAY** or **ARSONISTS GET ALL THE GIRLS**. The second track sucks too, just some stupid cowboy riffs. Don’t open with your worst tracks, y’all.

Plus, this band used to be heavier. Check out this piece of pure sludge from their debut album!

I mean, I’m torn. I don’t want to say, “Oh, you guys should’ve kept making that album”. Also, maybe they didn’t want people saying that they were ripping off Neurosis or some other band like that. Which they’re not! God, that whole album was sweet, actually. Grey Wolves kicks ass, too. Our Sun, Our Saviour ends with some crushing, super-dense riffage - the perfect way to cap off a song.

I still like the new album overall, though. I keep coming back to it despite my reservations. Does it deserve an [8.1 from Pitchfork](http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/reviews/albums/15936-an-ache-for-the-distance/)? Idunno. I think it’s still rough around the edges, and I would never tell my mnstrm friends to “check out THIS metal band”.  It has tits on the cover too, which is dumb – I prefer the triangle with wings, of course. 

I’ve got high hopes for these guys, though. Hope Pitchfork reviews their next album too.
