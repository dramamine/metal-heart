# Translated: Meshuggah – Chewing Dead Bodies

(“Translated” is a series where I translate [Death Metal English](http://www.invisibleoranges.com/2013/11/death-metal-english/) into plaintext for noobs.)

Pay the ogre with bad vision so that he'll leave us alone. Seriously, he'll beat us. Fear of death keeps us from being truly free.

Society doesn't care that you're near death – it's just waiting to chew your body.

It's Saturday! You're insane.
