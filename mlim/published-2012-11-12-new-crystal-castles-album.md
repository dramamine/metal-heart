# New Crystal Castles Album!

**CRYSTAL CASTLES**! Oh god, [these guys are good live](http://www.welovedc.com/2011/03/18/we-love-music-crystal-castles-930-club-31511/ "a review I wrote of their live show circa 2011"). Who doesn't have a crush on Alice Glass?? LIAR, DON'T LIE.

Their first album was pretty unique at the time; fat bass, Nintendo bleeps and bloops, lo-fi distorted vocals. It's pretty experimental, as well; just all over the goddamn place. It's dystopian dance music. Since then, their music has become more focused; still creepy, but less jarring.

At least, that's what I thought until I hit the track "Insulin" on their new album. It screams, WAKE UP, SHEEPLE! Just kidding; Alice Glass would fucking stare her lazer eyes through your brain if you said the word 'sheeple' in her presence. But it's got that mega-bass, the kind that's so far in the red that it distorts the melody. Then, the fuzzy melody drops out completely and all you're left with is its ghost, a bass line that just barely reminds you of what you just almost had in your head.

Crystal Castles eats dubstep for lunch and witch house for dinner.

There's a really pleasant song at the end of this album called "Child I Will Hurt You". Something tells me I'm missing something by not reading the lyrics.
