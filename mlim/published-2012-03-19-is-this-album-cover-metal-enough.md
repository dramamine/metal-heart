# Is This Album Cover Metal Enough?

Jesus Christ.

I love it.

**GOROD** is a tech / prog / death metal band from France. 
[Gorod - Elements And Spirit](../static/mp3/03.-elements-and-spirit.mp3")

The whole album has this 'classic' feel - lots of wanky riffs going up and down scales, played blazing fast. This usually isn't my cup of tea...but it used to be. I went through a phase awhile ago where I was listening to lots of **ANATA** and **EMETH**. Bands like this just bleed with technical prowess, every riff cuts like razorblades.
