Like I am? Over and over, 10x on repeat?

A lot of people complain because **DEFTONES** have changed their style a whole lot since the days when "My Own Summer (Shove It)" got radio play. Personally, I think it's fucking awesome. Every new Deftones album is exciting to me. They are not afraid to mix things up, and I think they do a great job of ramping up the heaviness on each new release. Also, I consider Chino to be a musical genius. I mean, I think about guys like Maynard James Keenan and Mike Patton who are bursting with creativity, so much that one band ain't enough for them. Chino's been doing chill projects like **TEAM SLEEP** and **CROSSES** in his spare time, which I guess let him unwind until he brings his A-game to the Deftones.
