# AxCx Frontman Dies

Mostly shocking because it didn't happen sooner. **ANAL CUNT** was a grindcore band beloved for their super-offensive titles. Here's a few tracks:

[Anal Cunt - You Keep a Diary (1996)](/assets/mp3/04-you-keep-a-diary.mp3)

[Anal Cunt - You Quit Doing Heroin, You Pussy (2001)"](/assets/mp3/12-you-quit-doing-heroin-you-pussy.mp3)

[Anal Cunt - Fuck Yeah (2010)"](/assets/mp3/01-fuck-yeah.mp3)

That last one is, like, an 80s hair-metal grind track. NOT BAD. 
Here's [The Onion's AV Club](http://www.avclub.com/austin/articles/the-av-club-anal-cunt-song-title-quiz,27093/) laughing over their titles. If you need more, [Allmusic's guide](http://www.allmusic.com/artist/ac-p200312/discography) is pretty detailed, but for a full list you'll need to go [here](http://www.metalstorm.net/bands/discography.php?band_id=3974&bandname=Anal+Cunt).

Here's [an email](http://www.reddit.com/tb/hzrsk) to their sound engineer.

Anyway you can call it dumb and stupid and offensive, but I think if this band didn't exist, the world would be worse off. 1st amendment - you have the right to offend. You have the right for people to not UNDERSTAND you. You have the right to not give a FUCK what other people think. You have the right to live your life METAL.
