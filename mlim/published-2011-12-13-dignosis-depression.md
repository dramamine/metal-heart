# Dignosis: Depression.

So I went to see **TOUCHE AMORE** last weekend at the Red Palace. I went to the show alone. You never really go to a show alone though, since you've got bros in the mosh pit, of course. In this particular case, my bros all had X's on their hands. It's okay with me to be the oldest at a show, since I've been the youngest at a show many many times before. And for anyone who likes the kind of music we like, age is just a number. Less than a number, even. Metal cuts across any and all dividing lines.

But yeah, one of the reasons why I listen to hardcore and screamo is because metal lyrics either suck or are unintelligible. **TOUCHE AMORE** lyrics really spoke to me. All those themes of isolation, etc. that you get with metal all the time, if you're paying attention. But at some point, I realized it was way more than that. Their singer has a ton of passion, where he'll scream with no mic, where he cares so much about the lyrics that he'll turn his back to the audience just to let his true emotions out.

But the lyrics are more than just depressing. He is *legitimately depressed*. I could see the sadness in his eyes. Just to prove it, I thought I would [google "symptoms of depression"](http://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/detecting-depression) and cross-reference them with TOUCHE AMORE lyrics. Guess what! There are lyrics that _prove every symptom_. Here; listen to this song while you read:

What's crazy is that I could actually come up with _MORE SYMPTOMS_ for depression, based on **TOUCHE AMORE** themes, that the fucking DSM IV doesn't even touch on. Like, what about all the rock-bottom-hitting, numbness-feeling, friend-avoiding, pointlessness-of-life, noone-understands-me, diary-writing, apologizing, fear of the world? What about that? Fuck, this guy scores like 19 on an 11-point scale.
