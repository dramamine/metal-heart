# Translated: Gojira – Where Dragons Dwell

(“Translated” is a series where I translate [Death Metal English](http://www.invisibleoranges.com/2013/11/death-metal-english/) into plaintext for noobs.)

I have something inside me, that drives me to action. When I’m not pursuing it, I get restless. When I deny it, my life loses meaning and my internal state collapses. If I don’t gather all my strength for this goal, I’ll fail.

That something is a dragon. A dragon lies in the heart of all men. (It’s a metaphor, people.)
