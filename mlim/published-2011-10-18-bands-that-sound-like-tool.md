**COG** wanted to be the Australian version of *TOOL*.

[(2005) Cog - Doors (Now And Then My Life Feels Like It's Going Nowhere)](/assets/mp3/10-doors-now-and-then-my-life-feels-like-its-going-nowhere.mp3)

Doors is the song Cog wrote when they were trying to write Tool's Pushit. This song is amazing, but you have to give it a few minutes to get going, just like Pushit. If you only heard the first minute of Pushit, where would you be today? But yeah, I love that moment where the guitars turn all muscley, and he just starts raging about being trapped. I think those doors are closed, y'all.

**COG** should've had a sweet logo. You've seen the *TOOL* logo, right? The [phallic wrench](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Tools-Phallic-Wrench/172218202812603)? Why didn't **COG** have the letters C-O-G written in... _COGS?_ All the letters are round - it's practically designed for this. If **COG** had a logo of cogs, _I would have a **COG** logo tattooed on my body._[^1]

Instead, of a sweet logo, **COG** opted to get their own Serif font I guess.

I had pretty high hopes for their next album after "The New Normal". The first single that leaked was pretty epic, and if you had asked me at the time, I would've told you about how ***Cog*** were crafting a new version of activist rock. Getting political with your music is a high-risk, high-reward action, but hell, <a href="http://mylifeismetal.com/?p=397">who needs one more love song</a>?

[(2008) Cog - What If](/assets/mp3/04-what-if.mp3)

The album came out and was totally lame; none of the songs had the same energy as "What If"...and none of them were as loud as the old **COG**.

Speaking of old **COG**, I like this geeky track:
[(2000) Cog - 1010011010](/assets/mp3/03-1010011010.mp3)

Put down your calculator - that's 666 in binary.

[^1]: This is pretty likely, in fact, since I was busy getting my APC tattoo in Australia the same semester I saw Cog live. Missed your chance, Cog.
