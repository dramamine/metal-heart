Death metal cover of that annoying Rebecca Black song. The best part is at 2:05. I think the video is pretty amusing, but I'm also embarrassed for this band. See, they took a lot of time to learn every nuance of that Rebecca Black song. If you're a metalhead, you shouldn't even acknowledge Rebecca Black's existence. Your musical diet is very strict, and there's no room for some mass-appeal, Disney-fied tween sensation. Acknowledging pop culture at all is kind of a faux pas, IMO.

P.S. in the original, it was already creepy the way she smiled when she sang...doubly creepy in this version.
