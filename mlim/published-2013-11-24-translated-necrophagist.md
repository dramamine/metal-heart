# Translated: Necrophagist – Get Some Variety In Your Diet!

(“Translated” is a series where I translate [Death Metal English](http://www.invisibleoranges.com/2013/11/death-metal-english/) into plaintext for noobs.) 

Ingredients: one body

It’s recommended to have some experience in deviant butchery.

Remove the head and tear open the chest.
Chop off any appendages.
Take out any entrails.
Store nutritious organs if you like them; place the rest in the compost bin.
