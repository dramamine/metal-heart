This blog ain't looking too metal right now, but you know what?  IDGAF.

Katy Perry is hot, sure, but this is one of the least metal things I've ever seen.  There's a complete lack of metal energy in this.  Even if she wasn't dressed like a candy cane, this is just some lame distorted-guitar-messing-around stuff.  Even Evanescence is heavier than this.
